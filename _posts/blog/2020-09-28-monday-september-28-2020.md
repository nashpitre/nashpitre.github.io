Lake Charles, Louisiana — Rebuilding a home out here and listening to podcasts the entire time. After hours: Mixing down a new album to its final form. Reading a book that’s very inspiring (The Organised Writer). And in between all of that, as I’m thinking about ideas, I’m playing Stardew Valley on the iPad with an Xbox controller. This is my current life as we speak.

I have projects starting to pile up. Creativity is back. Ideas are flowing in. It’s taken me way too long to get the ball rolling again on writing, but I never forced it. I understand that it was a weird year, and my daily routine would look the same for awhile. So instead, I took that time to rest. To keep a clear mind. To prepare for the next season in my life. That season is finally here, and I’m excited to start executing again.

If we take a look at our world today, it’s as bad as its ever been in my entire life. A pandemic that is killing people and killing businesses. Politics bleeding over into every part of our society, whether we like it or not. I never in my life thought I’d see an entire population wearing dystopian masks casually around town. It all feels like a movie. It’s surreal what we’re witnessing on a daily basis.

The worst part about all of this is that we’re so used to the chaos now, that we’ve become accustomed to it. It’s become who we are, we adjusted to this new landscape and kept living our lives. Netflix stock continues to rise, so no matter how bad it is outside, there’s something new to escape to on your big TV. Protest, riots, activism, athletes getting involved to try and help, and a debate between between democrats and republics that are at complete odds, which only matches the division we’re seeing in the people around us.

We don't like each other. I thought we did, and I know there’s good people out there — I meet them often, these people are hanging on by a thread to the little bit of normalcy we have left. Everyone else, as I passively hear their conversations, are as ready for a civil war as you could possible be. There’s no compromise. There’s no respect for the other side. There’s no agree to disagree. It’s all one big yelling match of hatred. Each side appears to be right, if you ask their followers. Each side is completely wrong, if you ask the other side. Welcome to politics.

How did I ever get myself involved in all of this? I’m at peace with it. But I also know that it’s about to get much worse.

If I could offer any advice to anyone that’s willing to listen, it’s this: Study both sides. Don’t just be a cheerleader for the one you love most (or to expand this: the one that keeps popping up on your news feed, because of algorithms, causing confirmation bias). Do your research, take notes,and get a full understanding of what you’re up against. Ignorance is not excuse. Know your enemy.
