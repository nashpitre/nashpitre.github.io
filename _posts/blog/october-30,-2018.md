## nshp.xyz

I’ve setup a custom branded url shortener last night, so when something new is posted on my site, it automatically generates a nshp.xyz url. This tweet shows an example.

Otherwise, that url would’ve looked like this:

## Financial Peace University

Tonight is the last meetup for this group. A 9 week group that helps you better with your money. In the last month, I’ve paid off a $800 bill, saved $1,000 emergency fund, have all of my bills ready an extra month in advance, and **stopped** eating out for almost a month now (the biggest achievement out of all of these).

## Creative Minds: October

I updated the [post for the October event][2], and I added the group picture, and all the doodles from everyone that night.

## Apple Event

30 minutes away from the last Apple event of the year. By the time you read this, this will be old news. New iPad, Apple Pencil and new Macs are what’s expected to be released.

## Creative Minds: November

I started early for this next event, with a [flyer][3] ready for promotion. Hoping to have a very successful event November 30th.

## Red Dead Redemption 2

Spent the weekend playing [Red Dead][4]. We created three different saves: one for me, for my sister, and for my brother — We’re all many hours into the story, as we took turns keeping up with each other. We’re having a great time playing the game.
