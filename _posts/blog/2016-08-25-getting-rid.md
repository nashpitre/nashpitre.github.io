I've cut my possessions down to about 70% from last year. Studying minimalism has been one of the greatest decisions I've ever made. It's helped with my peace and anxiety—It was one of many steps I've taken to improve my life.

I can't stress this enough: you don't need as much as you think. When I bought a new pair of shoes a few months back, I got rid of almost all of my other shoes. I only kept one pair of dress shoes, one pair of basketball shoes, and then my new everyday shoes. Since buying my everyday shoes though, it's been the *only* pair of shoes I've put on. The other two are technically not even needed, but I'm a basketball player, and if I get invited somewheres nice, I'll need more than tennis shoes.

I'll be talking about this a lot more going forward, but this tweet inspired me to share some thoughts on the matter.
