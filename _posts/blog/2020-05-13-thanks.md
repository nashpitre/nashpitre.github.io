He saw me at my lowest, and now he’s leaving with me at my highest. You meet people in life, and it doesn’t matter the amount of time you’ve known each other. You can make an impact in small windows of time. It’s so important to remember that.

## May 5, 2019

2. I’m thankful for the Rockets win last night. For how aggressive they were and how focused Chris Paul was when the ball was in his hands.

## May 3, 2019

It’s a healthy revolving door of memories. A constant flow of people and moments that transition in and out of my life. It’s a beautiful thing.

3. I’m thankful for this new confidence that I have each day. Through each conversation I have with someone, and the way that I’m approaching situations and life as a whole, I feel a sense of purpose and vision that isn’t slowing down.

3. I released a new shirt last night. I’ve released a dozen shirts over the years, but this is the first one I’ve made for myself. “Be the light” is what the shirt says. And I’m excited to start wearing that on my chest.

## April 29, 2019

1. Water and black coffee. No sugars. No sodas. No creamer. When you fall in love with just water, and just coffee, with nothing added, drinking becomes so much easier. It's very accessible. I love that it’s all I drink most days.
2. The phone call I just had with a friend. We talked a lot about speaking voices and being motivated and my packing skills and how I pack each morning for an adventure.
3. The counter in my kitchen. Huge open space with nothing on it. It’s been my new favorite place to setup. My iPad is opened ready to type, my bag is next to it, opened up, making sure I have everything for the day. Water and coffee is on the right side of it. It then becomes my standing desk. To create and plan.

2. My plans for this weekend. Lately, all weekends have been an adventure, and this one is no different. Traveling, videos, Avengers, two churches.
3. The mentors that I have in my life. As I watched a video on RightNow Media this morning, I was reminded of the older and wiser people I have in my life that I'm so thankful for: Mrs. Tracy, Mr. Bill, and Mr. Joe are the three that come to mind.

It brings me right back to that moment with my friends.
