Soon we will all be old. Each one of us. Time is something we let fly by, and life pauses for a second, asking us to look at it, and appreciate it, but we never do. And if we do appreciate it, it's only a brief moment, then we scramble to get back to our chaotic life, where speed is all we know, and moments aren't moments anymore, they are days, then weeks, then 20 years have gone by, and moments that we forgot to notice, are now absent.

As the mirror evolves, and we watch ourselves slowly change with age, if we stare a bit longer, we can remember a younger, more careless us. Hard times have made us wiser, and more serious, and we let go of the foolishness that once made us smile. Long ago, we were kids. We laughed. We didn't have bills to worry about, only the next stage in Super Mario. But life is ruthless. It's fighting to erase the old memories.

My mind flashes to condensed memories of me, around the age of four, following my dad as he filmed a Christmas night in our trailer. Nothing eventful happened in this moment, just my dad recording the family and walking around doing a tour of our proud home at the time, and I shadowed him for the attention of the video camera.

Just another memory slipping away. These writings preserve this one a bit longer.
