title: How To Find Yourself
---

I'll expand on this more later. But for now, here's to helping a friend who simply said:

> I don't know how to find myself.

I found myself through checklist. Through books. Through writing. Through pastors. Through creating little projects that have deadlines. Through writing three things I'm thankful for for 100 days. Through having coffee with people that are wiser than me. Through helping those in need. Through traveling. Through exploring local areas that I usually overlook. Through a variety of small groups at my church. Through recording a new album. Through collaborating and being creative with others. Through cleaning up and donating things that I don't love. Through shrinking my bills. Through finding new friends. Through podcasts. Through YouTube videos. Through spending time with family. Through spending time alone, at a park.
