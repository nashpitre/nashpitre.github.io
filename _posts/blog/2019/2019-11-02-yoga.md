title: Yoga
---

I started yoga a few months ago. I'm headed there in a few minutes. It's something new for me: to stretch, to stay grounded, to gain patience, to meditate. It's something that's completely different for me, and even a bit uncomfortable at times. I'm still learning the basics, but I know that, ultimately, it's just another layer that I can add to my life. It's also another chance for community. To find new friends and people to spend time with. It doesn't have to be yoga, but I encourage you to try something, anything that's new and different than your everyday routine. Keep finding ways to be uncomfortable.
