title: A Ticking Clock
---

Most sites, under their blog post title, have a date that shows when the article was published. I spent an hour the other day doing something similar, but also a little different. Each post on my site now has a weekday, date, and time underneath each title. Look close though. It’s the current day of the week, and the current time, and the current second. It’s a live clock, ticking away.

As you read, and as you notice the seconds ticking away, I hope it reminds you about this current moment that you’re in. The date something was created is irrelevant. Only now matters. Time is moving. Things are happening. Just keep building.
