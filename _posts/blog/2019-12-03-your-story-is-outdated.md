title: Your Story Is Outdated
---

Your story is outdated. You’ve been telling people a version of yourself that is no longer relevant. Your childhood. Your past relationship. Your last success. An old addiction. A highlight in your life that you’re really proud of. A roadblock that’s been there for years. It’s all outdated. It was important at one point in your life, but not anymore. You wrapped your identity around it. You bragged about it. You dwelled on it. And now it’s just there, as a wall, and as a declaration of who you claim to be. Now it’s holding you back, because you still carry that title and identity. Let it go. Tell people something new. Something real. Something about the person you are right now. Tell them about the person you dream of being. Update your story.
