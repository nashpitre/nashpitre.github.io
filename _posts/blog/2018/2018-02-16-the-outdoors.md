Most of my life has been spent around distractions: the city, the lights, the screens, the retail stores. My dad and my brother had it right all these years. They were always fishing and hunting, and I was always doing everything *but* that. If I could go back to each time they asked me to join them, I’d do things differently. What I’m learning is how much nature helps with anxiety and thinking. Fresh air, trails, water, and space to breathe, are some of the purest gifts of life, but I’ve always overlooked them.

Until now.
