![Bookshelf][image-1]

My mom built this bookshelf out of pallets. Even though it's already hanging on my wall, it's still a work in progress: the middle shelf needs to come out a little more so the books don't fall off, and I'm still deciding on what I should fill the rest of the spaces with (most of the things on there now are just place holders). But I wanted to show off what a great job my mom is doing on all these little projects I give her. 

My new hobby is transforming different areas of my room, and it's because of her that these ideas are coming to life.
