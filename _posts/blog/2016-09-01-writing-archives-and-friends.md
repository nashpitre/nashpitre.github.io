I have so many blog posts that I'm currently working on. Can't wait to share them with you. I could remember earlier this year, when I had nothing to say. I couldn't think of anything to write about on my site. I didn't stress over it though, I knew it wasn't my season to say anything. But now, that season is definitely over, because words are pouring out of me. I feel like everything is finally clicking. As a writer, that's the best feeling in the world.

I want to tell you about a page that I've never talked about before: [nashp.com/archives][1] — It's where I'll start organizing my favorite tags (like the Featured Posts, or Guest Posts, or the new Minimalism one). You can also get a full list of every post, with just the titles, allowing you to easily find older ones. I use this page a lot to quickly grab a link and share it. 

What I'm trying to say is...if you've ever enjoyed my writing or my music, you're in luck, because I feel more inspired than I ever have in my entire life. A huge thanks goes to Joseph , John,  Chase,  Devin, and Stu. Just a few guys that come to mind right away. They're part of the reason I'm on fire right now. They think I'm helping them, but they have no idea. They're the ones actually helping me.
