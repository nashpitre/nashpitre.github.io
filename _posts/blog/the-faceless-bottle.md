There once was a face. He’s gone now. A minimal and simple gesture that signifies the changing of a season. Just finding ways to become more selfless. This world is so much bigger than one single person. It’s easy to forget that when you’re trapped inside of your own little bubble. How can I use my gifts to help others, while remaining humble and faceless? My vision, my purpose, my calling, it’s for everyone else. It’s not about me.
