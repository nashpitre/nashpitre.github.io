Family and friends. Don’t take those two for granted. I’ve seen new people and new items come into my life that seem fulfilling, but looking back, they were only temporary.

When you have someone that you’re close to, that knows you extremely well, and understands your goods and your bads, treasure that person. Let them know that you appreciate them.

We get caught up on these temporary things that seem fun, and we tend to forget about what truly matters.

We go through high moments, where everything feels perfect, or we go through low moments, where the world seems unfair and cold. The key is to find consistency and understand that everything will balance out.

Be spontaneous, but never forget about the people that are there for you no matter what direction your life is headed.
