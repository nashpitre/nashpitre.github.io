title: Give Thanks
---

Give [thanks][1]. That’s one thing that I know now more than anything. Be thankful for everything. It could all be taken away tomorrow. People, possessions, jobs: everything has an expiration date. It’ll all be gone soon, so treat each blessing as if you only have a brief moment with it. Take care of it. Leave it better than you found it. None of this is technically yours, so be a good steward to all things placed in your life. The people that’s there, treasure them. The possessions you own, take care of them. The time you’re given each day, use it as if the clock is ticking, because it is. Stay away from complacency. Stay uncomfortable. Find new ways to live your life to its fullest potential. And above all else, give thanks.
