Been waking up at 5, but struggling to stay awake afterwards. Usually I go back to sleep for an hour or so. 5 am run, read, write is the ultimate goal. It’s hard to be on top of this when I’m away from home working, but I at least want to get used to waking up that early. Preparing my body. This frenchpress is helping this morning.

Last night, I downloaded Reeder 5. Ready to move back to RSS and get away from Twitter again. Having the right RSS reader and the right sources, can end up being much better than what I use Twitter for. From organization, to less noise, to a place to read just the text instead of everything their website throws at me. Another big reason is to get into the habit of not having to check it frequently. I can schedule time for RSS, instead of it taking up more time than it should.

Last night I opened up my [Theme System][1] journal, which I used for the first month of this year, before being distracted by the world again. But that first month—when I fasted from the iPhone and iPad, and read more books—was the exact thing that transformed my year into what it is now. I credit all the success and big changes in my life to that single point in time. Well, I’m preparing to close out the year with that journal, and hopefully make some more good changes in my life. End the year strong.
