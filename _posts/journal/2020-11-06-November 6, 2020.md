At the coffee shop. Doing admin work. Trying to get into the routine of Fridays being my admin day. Paying bills and collecting payments.

I have a Kindle Oasis on the way. Just got the notification that it just shipped. Thanks to my Paperwhite’s battery life acting weird, Amazon told me to pick any Kindle I want for free. The Oasis, with built-in cellular, is the one I chose. The thought of never having to worry about WiFi again when reading is something I look forward to. I also look forward to having physical buttons to press as I read with one hand, instead of swiping the screen to turn the page.
