I was asked the other day why I share so much publicly. That was an interesting question to me, because I think I’m very reserved, and don’t share enough. I look at my social accounts and I see emptiness and closed off. I like it that way. But on my site, from someone that sees the very personal music, and the journals, and the vulnerability, I can see how that question is asked. So the question is, which person am I? The one that is reserved and doesn’t share anything, or the one that, on his blog, he’s an open book? That’s interesting to me.

When I think about it, I know the answer. I’m willing to share *everything*, as long as I control the narrative. I don’t want these social networks to dictate the story of my life. I want to be the director, and my own platform allows me to do that. The reason I’m an open book is because I believe there’s beauty in everything. Every personal story, every perspective, every journey—if we’re able to remove the noise, and get real with each other, that’s the sweet spot.
