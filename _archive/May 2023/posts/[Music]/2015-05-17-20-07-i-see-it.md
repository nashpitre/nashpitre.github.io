# I See It (New Beginning)

> When you learn to love yourself, everything else is easy. I'm becoming a better person and I see it.

This new song is a celebration of life. If you've ever been knocked down, you know the process of getting back up is one to appreciate. Rebuilding yourself is a redemption story. I captured that here.
