---- 

The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people who love us most.

---- 

	Somebody that I relate to
	When you told me
	Your story
	It made me want you
	Even more
	You were brought up
	The granddaughter with heart
	Could've went
	Any direction but north
	Could've gave up
	But you fought it
	Abusive relationship
	Could've scarred you
	Came out smarter
	Thanking those
	That made it harder for you 
	Don't know how we crossed paths
	But I'm glad
	You told me
	Everything happens for a reason
	It feels like
	You're important to me

---- 

	Your broken heart
	It's in repair
	You feel like
	Love isn't there
	But something is
	In the air
	God has a plan for you
	He has his hands on you
	Rebuilding your foundation
	Redemption is groundbreaking

---- 

The Mask is our protection, and when it’s removed, we’re completely vulnerable.

The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept.

---- 

	Everybody's got their mask on
	But when you make eye contact
	That's a sad song
	I see your pain
	And I promise
	It won't last long
	When the world starts to crumble
	Just turn it to Nash songs
	
	Beautiful lady
	I see it all
	In your circle
	You're thinking
	I don't have to
	Compete with y'all
	This is bigger than your job
	This is your entire life
	You do it all for your son
	This time
	You're gonna do it right.
	
	Consumed by the night
	Get it out of them
	Put your mask on
	And smile for them
	
	Just do what you gotta do
	The bills are still due
	And doing it
	By yourself ain't new.

---- 

	Your broken heart
	It's in repair
	You feel like
	Love isn't there
	But something is
	In the air
	God has a plan for you
	He has his hands on you
	Rebuilding your foundation
	Redemption is groundbreaking

---- 

The question I ask myself: Is the mask protecting me from the world? Or is it protecting the world from me?
