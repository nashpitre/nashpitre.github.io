Elliot:

> Please. You have to do something. You have to help me. Say something to make him tell me-

Mr. Robot:

> Stop talking to them! They can’t help us. We have to do this together. Just us.

Elliot:

> This isn’t my family. None of them are real.

Mr. Robot:

> Neither is whoever you’re talking to.

Elliot:

> You’re not real.

Mr. Robot:

> And what? You are?

	The Uprise
	What are we doing
	Destruction is coming
	I've been searching for something
	That feels like electricity
	Uprise
	Lightening bolts and thunder
	We're coming for your heart
	Give it to me
	Let's go

	These is the signs of a breakthrough
	But don't let them break you
	Reflection of your face
	And the mirror that paints you
	
	I'm Nash
	Welcome to my mistakes
	They'll love you or hate you
	But don't let them take you
	
	Integrity's everything
	Respect is my second name
	Don't talk about something
	If it definitely ain't you
	
	So is it you or the fake you?
	Signs of a breakthrough
	But don't let them break you
	
	The mind of satan
	And the heart of an angel
	Complicated combination
	How can I save you?
	
	Gas mask
	You're not safe in this environment
	Training for assignment
	Change is on the horizon
	
	Danger
	Blame the drugs
	That are circulating
	Blank faces
	Zombies impersonated
	
	This is the fight for survival
	Reporting live from my iPhone

	Lightening bolts and thunder
	We're coming for your heart
	Give it to me
	One more time

	This is the mind of the wicked
	Hurry, the time's ticking
	Replicated faces
	How do you define different?
	
	The screen is the master
	Staring at you through glass
	Could have a real connection
	Accepting my friend request
	
	Access granted
	Now I'm vulnerable and damaged
	Who's got the most likes?
	Who's the last man standing?
	
	It's a popularity contest
	That makes me panic
	There's a circus in town
	And the crowd starts chanting
	
	Clowns start dancing
	Fire's the entertainment
	Burn the city down
	Party 'til it starts raining
	
	Selfies in the crowd
	They're loving you
	'Cause you're famous
	Bodies hit the ground
	The innocent didn't make it
	
	Sweat dripping
	You're living it up
	Ain't ya
	Party like it's your last day
	Yea, that's the saying
	
	Gotta fight for survival
	Reporting live from my iPhone

The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people that love us most. The Mask is our protection, and when it's removed, we're completely vulnerable. The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. The question I ask myself: is the  mask protecting me from the world, or is it protecting the world from me?
