## Hook

	There's a monster
	In my head
	I cannot get it out
	Figured I have it
	Under control
	But I'm still in doubt
	
	There's blood
	All over my face
	It's like a mask to me
	Friends become acquaintances
	They're the past to me

## Verse 1

	There's a whirlwind
	Inside of me
	Better person I try to be
	But it gets harder by the day
	
	Keep your heart Three Stacks
	Keep your heart
	
	Don't let them take it
	Meditation, dedication
	Celebration, for elevation
	Steady patient
	
	Whatever it takes to make it
	Through the day
	I simplified my lifestyle
	So I can be ok
	They see my mask peeling off
	They think they're losing me
	
	You see the cracks in my skin
	Start to illuminate
	Like Dr. Manhattan
	Blue is glowing through my face
	
	I can't control it
	No antidote
	Now it's panic mode
	I feel if I reveal what's killing me
	Eventually it'll start healing me
	My plans to grow
	
	You never know what'll happen
	When you take actions on your flaws
	You feeling trapped
	Behind these walls
	So you start painting on them
	
	Imagination makes a closed door
	An opened one
	But now the monster's walking out
	With a loaded gun

	Figured I have it
	Under control
	But I'm still in doubt
	
	There's blood
	All over my face
	It's like a mask to me
	Friends become acquaintances
	They're the past to me

## Verse 2

	So much blood from my history
	All these puddles
	Don't make sense to me
	This isn't me
	
	I close my eyes
	And see a different me
	But I'm sure
	From your perspective
	You see it differently
	
	If you're listening
	I come in peace
	My intentions seem
	Always in the right direction
	But when you mix
	A broken heart with intensity
	
	That's ingredients
	To let the demons in
	The devil's hungry
	And I'm feeding him
	
	Can you free me
	From my mind?
	I see the blood trail behind
	There's blood on the leaves
	
	And I'ma need a little more time now
	'Cause I don't have
	My mask on me right now
	And I told you to wait
	Look me in my eyes
	No more face.

> The Mask.

Brayden:

> No, no, no. Watch this: THE MASK.

## Interlude

	Let's get it started
	I'm a hip-hop artist
	
	I was born with a recorder
	From the cradle to the grave
	The mic cable
	Wraps around the tombstone
	When it's time to pay respect
	The casket plays a new song
	
	I been lost inside a human body
	All my life
	So when I died
	The mannequin had a new suit on
	When they buried me
	They took my face on
	And hung it on the wall
	Between a trophy and a baseball
	This is memorabilia
	
	Don't interfere with a Death Note
	This is Kira
	In the mirror
	Staring at his reflection
	All sinners get corrected
	He feels like he perfected it.
	
	Day of reckoning
	This is destiny
	Mixed with Rest In Peace
	Press repeat
	Have a quest to be the best
	Self-growth is what I'm after
	Another chapter finished.

The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people that love us most. The Mask is our protection, and when it's removed, we're completely vulnerable. The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. The question I ask myself: is the  mask protecting me from the world, or is it protecting the world from me?
