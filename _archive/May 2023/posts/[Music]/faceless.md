Narrator:

> The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people who love us most. The Mask is our protection, and when it’s removed, we’re completely vulnerable. The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. The question I ask myself: Is the mask protecting me from the world? Or is it protecting the world from me?

### Verse 1

	Mask on
	Looking out of my glass home
	The surface is what I scratch on
	Trying to dig deeper
	And grab something
	
	I’m abnormal
	Got a notepad that I dab on
	To make a mad song
	Reflecting upon my past
	About to self-destruct
	Inside of this classroom
	
	Mask on
	I’m watching the world just pass on
	There’s nothing but trouble
	Around these parts
	They're doing (beep) drugs in the bathroom
	
	Try not to react to them
	Keep a straight face
	Get my act on
	Trafficking, my dad’s gone
	You wouldn’t know that
	'Cause my mask on
	
	Crossroads, think my path wrong
	Should I turn around or keep going forward?
	This déjà vu, it’s a maze I do
	This sound the same as my last song
	
	Crash course
	Life colliding with passion
	Task force, straight jacket on
	They’re bringing me to my actual home
	
	Imagery
	See it vividly
	Disturbing the way my words
	Create the turbulence
	Emergency landing
	Put your mask on.
	
	I’m the captain when I write
	Scribbling lyrics in the afterlife
	The wordsmith with a gift and a trapdoor
	So much English I need a backboard.

### Hook

	He's faceless
	Brace yourself for the changes
	Eyes of somebody dangerous
	Devil grabbed me by my ankles
	I’m dangling
	
	Nightmare from Wes Craven
	When the day ends
	I'm crazy. You crazy?
	Now you're speaking my language
	
	We're both lost in translation
	Bill Murray with Asians
	I'm faceless. I'm faceless.
	I done forgot what the (beep) myname is
	
	Reach down and grab my ink pen
	Brace yourself for the changes
	This feels like military training
	I'm faceless.

### Verse 2

	Son of a creator
	Dad's a carpenter
	I'm a painter
	Rearrange your
	Face with a piece paper
	Gotta love the mind of a laser
	Line them up and aim my thoughts
	
	To you I'm a stranger
	But really I'm the son of the Creator
	Sunrays are
	Shining down on the face of a stranger
	I'm faceless. Take this.
	
	When the bass hits nobody can save you
	Darth Vader with the art paper
	You in a songwriting contest
	With a tornado
	Crossfaders going back and forth
	Left and right
	See the lightning and wind is my friend
	When I strike with the pen
	Lift trailer parks up
	Rip them apart
	See the debris start spinning
	A metaphor when my CD starts spinning
	It's all venom, gotta keep my momentum
	It's all rhythm.
	
	Dear Heavenly Father, we're all sinning.
	No Bible, we're hiding from your religion
	Forget to raise our babies, too late
	Now they're all women.
	Sirens, gun violence, we're all killing.
	You're the pilot, the driver
	That identifies our itinerary
	Where we're headed
	You said it in your book of rhymes
	It's all ending.

Neil Gaiman:

> Secure your own mask before helping others. Ithink of us, all the people, and the masks we wear, the masks we hide behind and the masks that reveal.

### Verse 3

	What a beautiful nightmare
	Pains in my sight, yea
	Love doesn't fight fair
	
	Eyes of somebody
	That's done been through it all
	I done been through the falls
	Trials and tribulations
	Got a bunch of skeletons
	I been collecting them all
	Pile them up inside the closet
	Lean them against the wall
	
	All these demons I keep seeing
	Wish they'd leave me alone
	Put my mask on and join them
	Got a team full of horns
	
	This the new version of me
	I don't feel free anymore
	All this hate circulating
	Got the evilest thoughts
	
	All I see is the dark
	Write my way out of the maze
	All I see is the art
	It's like I'm feeding the sharks.
	
	Welcome to The Mask
	This is Nash
	This is my autobiography.
	
	Trapped inside of four glass walls
	Take my mask off
	All you see is fire in my eyes
	And my skin starts dripping
	As it leaks from the pencil
	
	Write my pain away.
	This is Training Day
	This is my release valve.
	This a beat down
	This is self-defeat now.
	As I try to go to sleep now
	Can I breathe now?
	
	The Mask.
	
	No love over here.
	Such a negative environment
	There's drugs over here.
	No hugs over here.
	Just fighting, animosity
	They got it out for me
	Raise my velocity
	
	Pain brought it out of me.
	
	Ask me where it comes from?
	I'm numb from it
	Family dying in front of me
	Feel nothing from it.
	What am I becoming?
	
	No emotions. Turning into a ghost.

Neil Gaiman:

> I imagine people pretending to be what they truly are, and discovering that other people are so much more, and so much less, than they imagined themselves to be, or present themselves as. And then, I think about the need to help others, and how we mask ourselves to do it, and how unmasking makes us vulnerable. We are all wearing masks. That is what makes us interesting. These are stories about those masks, and the people we are, underneath them.
