# [So Loud!](https://soundcloud.com/nashp/so-loud)

This ones different. This is a style from me that fans don't often see, but are always hoping for. This is Kevin Gates meets Nas. This is Kendrick Lamar on a rampage.

This is the song where I remind those that—even though I focus on storytelling and emotional music—I'm totally capable of delivering something with exciting intensity. I'm not limited to one particular sound. I enjoy being versatile, and this song should be a welcomed change of pace for those following along.
