Here's my 18th recording of the 2016 (the first public one), The Conversation. A heartfelt document of several conversations happening at once: a conversation with the listener, with myself, with a girl, and with Godâ€”all while someone is talking and having a conversation behind my words.

If you listen close, you can hear him. I layered it so you can't understand what he's saying, but you still know that he's there. His voice is just another instrument in the process. And then there's the conversation that happened in verse three: a phone call that took place while I was writing the lyrics.

So many elements went into making this little song, and it all came together in a matter of hours. I'm thankful for everyone that contributed.
