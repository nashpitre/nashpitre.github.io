Mr. Robot:

> “Remember how you felt when you were alone? You were in pain, you were miserable. That’s why we’re here.

## Hook

> Love ain’t here. I can see the breakdown baby. You’re trying to get me on the way down. I can see you’re fake now baby. Got no time for you to waste now.


Mr. Robot:

> You begged us to come. You asked us to come. You needed us to come!”

Elliot:

> “No! I want you to leave!

	Hook
	
	Life in the fast lane
	Let me slow down
	And try to figure it out
	Take off my mask
	See my real face
	See my real face.
	
	VERSE 1
	
	I been hiding from insecurities
	Nothing's what it appears to be
	Lusting for something real
	And it's killing me
	
	They keep telling me let it be
	But I'm forcing it
	Mentally fragile
	Porcelen
	Could shatter any second
	I'm battling with depression
	On the path to self-destruction
	Where's the love?
	I don't see it I'm suffering. 
	
	Love aint here.
	
	I been hiding from all my family 
	Friends feel like my enemies
	Incoming calls
	
	Leave a message after the beep
	Haven't replied to them weeks
	The pressure’s rushing in
	Struggle to breath
	I can't sleep
	
	Tell my,
	Cousin I love him
	Tell my momma I'll come visit
	When I can
	In the mirror
	I just stare at who I am
	
	I'm not good enough
	My confidence
	Has seen better days
	Feel like giving up
	I'm learning how to pray
	See the mask on my face
	
	Does it keep me safe
	From monsters?
	Or is the monster
	Behind the mask?
	
	I just summarized Nash.

	VERSE 2
	
	I been hiding from insecurities
	Nothing's what it appears to be
	Weight of the world has buried me
	Apparently,
	My mask has them scared of me
	
	I think I need therapy
	Fire inside of me’s raging
	Just waiting for caroseen
	
	Hiding from all the damage
	Scared to take any chances
	Not worried about advances
	Comfortable in a bubble
	I'm not humble enough
	
	My canvas is crumbling 
	Everyone is wondering
	Um,
	
	Am I good enough
	My confidence has seen better days
	Feel like giving up
	I'm learning how to pray
	See the mask on my face
	
	Does it keep me
	Safe from monsters?
	Or is the monster
	Behind the mask?
	
	I just summarized Nash

Siri: 

> Welcome to The Mask.

	INTERLUDE
	
	Gotta get this right.
	
	I'm wired up.
	Got the heart of a writer
	Got the mind of a fighter
	My thoughts are on fire
	
	On the wall and I'm tied up
	Time to create something
	That I'm proud of
	Give me a chance
	And I just might surprise ya.
	
	
	In the mirror
	My appearance says time's up
	But I reply that
	I'm just getting started
	Smarter and wiser
	
	My opponent's on dial up
	But I'm broader
	Abandoned all of those
	Negative thoughts in my mind
	Once I did that, I realized
	That I'm eye level with the sky
	Looking down at the ground
	My arrival to this world
	Came at the right time
	
	My motive (modem) is still
	Trying to connect with
	A generation that's AOL
	But add a W.
	They don't love you
	If you're nice
	So the mask is covering up
	Any resembles of
	Someone that gave a (beep)
	
	So now I'm plucking away
	At stray hearts
	It's like I'm playing cards
	And the hearts are staying dark
	Like a spade or Ray Charles
	And I'll raise you another grand
	And the band is on stage
	Made out of paper and crayons
	My little brother colored
	Outside of the lines of the minds
	And I'm blind
	I don't have my face on
	I'm a warrior, Draymond
	So (beep) it, it's game on.
	
	When the television came on
	It was all static
	And the past arrived back
	In my living room
	And sat next to me.
	
	I just attempted to stay calm
	Every death, every ex
	Everything I'm ashamed of
	Gathered around the room
	And pointed mirrors at me
	Until all I saw was myself
	
	Which was really what I was afraid of
	'Cause I was pointing the finger
	At every other angle
	But I'm really the blame for
	Any emotional pain caused
	Here's The Mask
	I'm in danger.

The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people that love us most. The Mask is our protection, and when it's removed, we're completely vulnerable. The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. The question I ask myself: is the  mask protecting me from the world, or is it protecting the world from me?
