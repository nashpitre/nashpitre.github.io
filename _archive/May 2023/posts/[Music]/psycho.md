> The Mask. the mask. The Mask. THE MASK.

	It's all a cycle
	Psycho when I write, though
	Looking like
	The mask of Michael
	
	With a resemblance of me
	What's the price of my life
	Walking a tightrope
	My past created a path, so
	Wherever I go
	It follows
	
	A role model
	Providing a blueprint
	Step away from the needle
	Just giving my two cents
	How the hell did I escape
	From the hell
	That they threw me into
	
	Gotta hurry and find me
	A better influence
	Promise that I won't follow
	What all my friends doing
	Problems are piling on top of him
	This kid's ruined
	
	I think it's time to
	Put an end to it
	Dear God,
	Be my mentor
	
	I put it all on the line
	I lost sight
	Of what happiness looks like
	But my mask shows
	That I'm fine
	What I'm battling inside
	You'll never know
	It's all backwards
	
	Laughing is a cry
	And my passion is a crime
	And I'm clashing with my job
	And I'm trapped in this disguise.
	
	Mask on
	Don't worry, my mask on
	I stare at the mirror
	Swallow pills in the bathroom
	Sleeping pills
	Anxiety pills
	Now I'm back calm
	Heartbeat slows down
	So now I'm half-normal
	Survived another night
	Somebody should clap for him
	Mind of the mask
	Thanks for the platform
	
	Gathered all around me
	They want me to rap for them
	The skills of a running wheel
	I feel like a rat to them
	Spinning in circles
	They're cheering on my verses
	Think I'm the only person
	Realizing I haven't gone anywheres
	I don't care
	So yea, laugh on
	Best rapper alive whenever
	My mask on
	
	But the pills must be working
	I'm talking out of my box
	If my mask happened to fall off
	The neighbors would call the cops
	I'm supposed to be the innocent one
	Now they're all shocked
	If you split me in half
	Which side would you want now?
	Cops knocking at my door
	They're telling me to come out
	Put my mask back on
	And open it with a smile

# Feeling Your Vibe

	I'm thinking about you
	Spent the weekend with you
	Now you question
	People around you
	
	See I treat you with kindness
	I'm respecting your mind
	It's the person that I am
	We're deep with our conversations
	
	A friendship for now
	But if it grows into something more
	I wouldn't be surprised
	
	I'm feeling your vibe
	You make me feel alive
	I'm inspired to capture this moment
	And turn it into a song, like
	
	I had a lot on my mind
	I started vented to you
	You were interested at the time
	
	I kept warming you that I'm different
	I'm not normal
	But you kept reassuring me
	It's my own insecurities
	You saw right through me
	
	Had my guard up
	And you broke it down
	Both of our lives are in transition
	New jobs with ambition
	We both have broken hearts
	Feels like we can't fix it
	Damaged people
	With trust issues
	
	But you smile in disguise
	And leave the worries behind
	Because the worst is behind us
	Optimistic, we climb
	You got a permanent shine
	And It's attractive
	Being just friends
	Gonna take practice 
	
	So just smile in disguise
	And leave the worries behind
	Because the worst is behind us
	Optimistic, we climb
	You got a permanent shine
	And It's attractive
	Being just friends
	Gonna take practice 
	
	I'm thinking about you
	Spent the weekend with you
	Now you question
	People around you
	
	See I treat you with kindness
	I'm respecting your mind
	It's just the person that I am
	We're deep with our conversations
	
	A friendship for now
	But if it grows into something more
	I wouldn't be surprised
	
	I'm feeling your vibe
	You make me feel alive
	I'm inspired to capture this moment
	And turn it into a song, like
	
	See you're beautiful lady
	You're confusing me baby
	'Cause you great a communication
	It's putting me on the spot
	You're challenging all my thoughts
	Off-balance
	I'm off of my game
	She looked directly at my mask
	And altered my pain
	
	This the life of dying poet
	I write my soul in the open
	And hope that when it arrives
	The message is still intact
	And have some kind of impact
	On the person it was directed at
	
	I feel the pressure.

The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people that love us most. The Mask is our protection, and when it's removed, we're completely vulnerable. The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. The question I ask myself: is the  mask protecting me from the world, or is it protecting the world from me?
