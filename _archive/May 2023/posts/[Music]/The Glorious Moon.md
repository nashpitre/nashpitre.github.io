## Lyrics

You either love it, or you’re in the way of it. I’ve been hiding from the public. Trying to find something that I can’t get. Trying to put me in a box that I can’t fit. Wake me up. I been trying to find answers. All this noise in the world, not a fan of it. Too many talking at once, can’t understand them. You should listen and absorb, instead of saying something. 

I’ve been paying attention: I see your character. You don’t accept it unless it fits your narrative. It’s imperative. Step back, get an aerial view. I zoom out, I feel out the room now, and now I’m aware of you.

Military mindset. Attention to detail. I’m finally me now. I’m finally free now, but how do I rebound? I took a year off. Tires done peeled off. I try to return, but now my mind is sealed off. None of my skills lost, so how do I build out the vision that I had in place? I could put it back together, I could crack the case. I got all these ideas, but they’re trapped in a safe. My backpack is a jet pack, blast to space. 

Slow down and adapt the pace. Get a glimpse of what I’m building, but my mind is running in circles, and I’m trapped in place. The gravity is too much for me. Gravity is too much for me. The gravity is too much for me. Hold on tight as we zoom through the night. I just fused with the moon, now I’m all of the light. I been looking for this moment like all of my life.
