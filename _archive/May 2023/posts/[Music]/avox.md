> Ordinary people chasing stars, stop to wonder who they really are. But the circles keep on closing around them. Fascinating fires draw them in. Promises of love thrown to the wind. But the circles never open for them.

	Life in the fast lane
	Everything is passing me by 
	Everything’s an after thought now 
	Caught up in the cloud
	That surrounds me 
	Drowning
	Nobody found me yet
	
	Bright lights blinding me 
	I search for myself
	But there’s no finding me 
	I been gone
	
	Let the memories of
	The old me live on 
	This version comes with a bar code.
	
	The Capital has captured my heart 
	And I’m trapped
	In a district with plastic parts 
	Connected to me
	
	Can somebody please
	Find an exit for me
	Or protection for me
	Or a weapon for me 
	
	I’m left with nothing
	And my voice is gone 
	Avox
	I can't stop
	
	All I see is makeup and smiles
	And blood runs down from my eyes
	PlasticSky.

	This world's gone mad 
	A war's going on Outside
	Fill up your bag and go
	
	Never know what you’ll need 
	So take it all 
	Whatever fits
	Don’t forget: medicine kits,
	Whatever’s edible, whatever can’t be useful,
	Let it go.
	
	Lots of water
	A mirror
	So you don’t forget
	Who you are tomorrow 
	When they try to change you 
	Train you, drain you, and make you
	
	Whatever they want
	They brainwash you 
	They can make your
	Best friend become silent 
	That’s what I am
	An Avox
	That grabbed a piece of paper
	And scanned it into the jam box
	
	Since I can’t talk, I became a song 
	The music is my thoughts
	Just keep singing every part 
	And hope you don’t get caught 
	Keep the darkness
	Away from your heart
	And keep ya mind sharp.

	The sky is falling 
	Time is on the outside looking in 
	And we can’t pretend
	Like we’re not losing 
	Only thing we have left is music
	
	And we’re losing that too 
	It’s a fight to the death
	
	Run for your life
	Put up a good fight
	
	All I need is one stage,
	one beat, one mic, all I need is one life
	
	One try, one breath, I’m one man
	And what I stand for 
	It speaks for itself
	
	They don’t understand
	But I do what I can
	Nas, the music world
	He’s our god
	And his book of rhymes is our bible 
	
	In hard times
	His lines, we recite them 
	The answers, we try to find them 
	
	Lost tapes
	Blank canvases
	We paint on 
	Have been removed 
	They say it’s not safe
	That we think on our own 
	Clones
