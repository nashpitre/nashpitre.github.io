> So, what is The Mask?

	It was lightning in a bottle
	Life is what the price is
	Reciting from the Bible
	What I'm typing's
	A silhouette of 
	A face that's suicidal
	When the thoughts start
	To takeover
	They control
	I follow
	
	My Mask started glow
	It was smoking
	From inside of it
	Wearing it. Cherish it
	Scared of life without it
	
	From embarrassment
	To marriages
	To parenting
	To arrogance
	To living up to comparison
	Still question who am I, though
	
	Mask is what we try to be
	Covering up what's inside of me
	The Mask will make you lie to me
	Just want you to be proud of me
	
	The Mask will make you follow me
	Cry to me. Hide from me.
	A fabricated society
	You'll never see the real side of me
	
	You'll judge me if you knew me
	So I'm hiding behind the music
	We're hiding behind computers
	Creating an image
	Of someone cooler
	
	None of us know what we're doing
	We're fragile. It's a battle
	Scared to death of what you'll think of me
	Life is but a dream to me
	
	Nothing's what it seems to be
	The Mask is for your secrecy
	My silence is a scream to me
	Just on a different frequency
	
	What the world is feeding me
	The demons always speak to me
	My pastor tries to balance out the Mask
	Can you preach to me?
	
	I'm going deeper
	From my cheeks, my eyes
	My noes, my smile
	What you see is not my face
	Take it off and see me now
	
	Watch me break the Mask in half
	And I just throw it
	Into the crowd
	As I take my skin off
	Imperfection's what I found

> The Mask.

The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people that love us most. The Mask is our protection, and when it's removed, we're completely vulnerable. The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. The question I ask myself: is the  mask protecting me from the world, or is it protecting the world from me?
