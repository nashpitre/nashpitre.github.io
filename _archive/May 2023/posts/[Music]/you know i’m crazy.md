Narrator:

> The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. (I see you in my dreams.) This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. (I don’t wanna go nowhere without you.)

	Maybe you look like
	Somebody I wanna get to know
	You look like trouble
	And trouble is all I seem to know
	
	The way you glow
	You're so intoxicating
	Two toxic people
	That's hurting
	The perfect combination
	
	It's complicated
	Baby, let's drop our faces
	The mask reveals the past
	Disasters here
	We're not gonna make it
	
	This is the life and times
	Of the isolated
	I'm hibernating
	I'm waiting to
	Self-destruct with you
	In love with you
	And I know you hate it.

### Hook

	You know I'm crazy
	I can't escape it
	But you're my favorite
	And I'ma prove it to ya
	I got this music for ya
	It's like a present for ya
	It's like I'm desperate for
	Whatever you want
	Whatever you need

### Verse 2

	Restraining order
	Damn, the pain I brought ya
	When I paint the portrait
	It makes it harder
	Take my face off
	
	You're my favorite horror
	Story
	Like I made it all up
	Like I'm Steven King now
	And it's just you and me now
	At least that's what I think now
	
	But really
	It's just me now
	As I sink down
	And I'm becoming senile
	Why you never
	Answer my email, voicemail
	Then redial
	
	I'm reaching out to you baby
	This mask makes me crazy

### Hook

	You know I'm crazy
	I can't escape it
	But you're my favorite
	And I'ma prove it to ya
	I got this music for ya
	It's like a present for ya
	It's like I'm desperate for
	Whatever you want
	Whatever you need

Narrator:

> The question I ask myself: Is the mask protecting me from the world? Or is it protecting the world from me?

> The Mask

### Verse 3

	I don't wanna go
	Nowhere without you
	But I'm trying to move
	On now without you
	
	As you can tell
	I don't really know how to
	This song is a mouthful
	I'm lost
	Inside of a soundproof room
	Screaming out to you
	You can't hear me
	But close your eyes
	And you can feel me

The Mask is a blanket that shields us from our insecurities. It disguises our worst flaws and attributes from even the people that love us most. The Mask is our protection, and when it's removed, we're completely vulnerable. The Mask allows us to have multiple identities. This gives us the advantage of using whatever face society's willing to accept. The question I ask myself: is the  mask protecting me from the world, or is it protecting the world from me?
