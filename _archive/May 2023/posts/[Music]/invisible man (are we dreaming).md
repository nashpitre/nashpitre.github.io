# Lyrics

	## Hook
	
	...Invisible Man
	I got a plan
	My silence
	Is strategic
	You can’t see me
	But I’m right behind you
	You can feel breathing
	I got a feeling
	They need me
	So I suit up
	Put my futuristic suit on
	And then I fuel up
	And then I peel off
	I’m beaming
	Are we dreaming?
	Are we dreaming?
	
	## Verse 1
	
	..It’s a fountain of youth
	A foundation I’ve built
	..A mountain of truth
	
	Keep doubting me
	
	..keep doubting
	I’m rebounding
	Your miss shots
	..Creating vivid story like I’m Hitchcock
	
	...keep doubting
	Your roadblocks
	Are my improv
	
	..They never see coming
	I attack from different angles
	
	You’re breaking my heart
	Where to start
	Tell a story for me is
	A tray from the arc
	I’m playing with art
	I break it apart
	And share it with you
	I’m breaking bread
	You sound scared
	Your voice sounds
	like you’re playing dead
	
	A chip was embedded inside my head
	and now the letters connect
	without me trying
	The words flying
	applying what I learned
	on the curve of Oakshire
	As a kid
	Now an adult 
	connecting those decades
	Like an echo
	
	Generations of families
	Are waving from the sky
	Looking down as I try
	But in disguise
	Who am I?
	
	## Hook
	
	Invisible Man
	When online
	
	...Invisible Man
	When offline
	My silence
	Is strategic
	You can’t see me
	But I’m right behind you
	You can feel breathing
	I got a feeling
	They
	need me
	So I suit up
	Put my futuristic suit on
	And then I fuel up
	And then I peel off
	I’m beaming
	Are we dreaming?
	Are we dreaming?
	
	## Verse 2
	
	This is the darkest hour
	The kids on autopilot 
	Let’s talk about it
	
	Staring at their iPhone compass
	lost and found
	Generation
	Is off to college
	I’m carving out a legacy
	Let me see what I can do about it
	
	Just a student of the mind
	And the music is hobby
	I feel an obligation
	To protect the younger
	Version of me
	From the nursery
	To the circled ring
	That I skated on
	To the basketball courts
	That I played on
	Trying to protect my siblings
	From Avon..Barksdale
	We’re spinning in circles
	Getting our maze on
	..This is what scribbling
	on the page does
	..Our differences make us amazing
	..I’m in the business of making changes
	
	Making an consistent impact
	on the babies
	So I’m on the way
	Hold on
	We’re gonna make it
	
	I’m either invisible
	Or the pivotal moment
	The sky is open
	I’m either the chosen one
	Or I found peace
	And It’s out of my control then
	
	## Hook
	
	...Invisible Man
	I got a plan
	My silence
	Is strategic
	You can’t see me
	But I’m right behind you
	You can feel breathing
	I got a feeling
	They
	need me
	So I suit up
	Put my futuristic suit on
	then I fuel up
	then I peel off
	I’m beaming
	Are we dreaming?
	Are we dreaming?
	
	## Verse 3
	
	Do you
	Do you
	
	Do you know me
	Do you know me
	Help me obey wan kanobe
	You’re our only hope
	I noticed that the noise is getting loudery
	our pride is getting prouder
	You don’t hear what I’m saying
	You’re just waiting
	For your reply
	
	In the darkness I hide
	Vigilante
	Got a feeling your opinion isn’t changing
	It’s complacency and anger
	Our enemy’s a stranger
	We never met
	But we get upset 
	If they say something
	we don’t agree with
	
	It’s the return of the rapper
	In background
	I’m back now
	I black out
	The bomb shelters at Nash house
	I’m just here for your safety
	See Your ear is amazing
	If you hear what I’m saying
	See They’re geared to replace me
	So I’m steering away
	Just know you’re not alone
	I’m building a basement
	That’ll shield me Incase
	And then I’m sealed and I’m safe
	I’ll appear in some years
	Brendan Fraser
	The future
	I’ll be your ace in hole
	
	Nash
	
	## Hook
	
	...Invisible Man
	I got a plan
	My silence
	Is strategic
	You can’t see me
	But I’m right behind you
	You can feel breathing
	I got a feeling
	They
	need me
	So I suit up
	Put my futuristic suit on
	then I fuel up
	then I peel off
	I’m beaming
	Are we dreaming?
	Are we dreaming?
