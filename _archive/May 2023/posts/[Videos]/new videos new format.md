# New Videos, New Format! (Instagram Story Highlights)

![](https://i.imgur.com/9Qfpq3z.jpg)

I’m back to creating videos again. This time as Instagram story highlights. I’m enjoying the constraints of 15 second clips, threaded together to make one little project. I’m not following the format that’s intended though. My videos aren’t vertical. Once you start watching them, you’ll have to turn the phone sideways to watch it, just like your traditional videos.

## Here’s a few of my most recent ones
