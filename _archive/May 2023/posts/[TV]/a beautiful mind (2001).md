# A Beautiful Mind (2001)

> After John Nash, a brilliant but asocial mathematician, accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish.

I watched this last night for the first time. I put it on to go to bed, not realizing that I'd stay up watching the whole thing. The story grabs you, and at one point, my heart was racing. I can relate to John Nash in many ways: our names, the way his mind never stopped, and then the weirdest thing is that he died on my birthday three years ago. After watching this, I'm extremely proud to have the name Nash.
