# Moonrise Kingdom

A brilliant and quirky film. Bruce Willis and Bill Murray play great roles in the movie, but it’s the two kids, Sam and Suzy, who steal the show. I heard good things about Moonrise Kingdom, and after finally watching it, I can see why everyone enjoyed it so much.

IMDb:

> Set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy and girl fall in love they are moved to run away together. Various factions of the town mobilize to search for them and the town is turned upside down — which might not be such a bad thing.

> September, 1965, a storm is three days away from the New England coast. At an island camp, a Khaki Scout’s gone missing: he’s Sam, 12, a bespeckled misfit, an orphan. Ward, his by-the-book scoutmaster, organizes a search after calling Captain Sharp, the local police. Sam is running away with Suzy, his pen pal, the laconic oldest child in a quirky and unhappy household of two lawyers (one of whom is having an affair with Sharp). As Sam and Suzy sort through their own issues, they stay a step ahead of the searchers while the storm gets closer.
