## We gather stones for

1. Protection — Walls
2. Perception — Watchtower
3. Production — Winepress

---

## Protection — Walls

We help fortify our lives from the attacks of the enemy by: 

- Reading God’s word
- Prayer
- Community (Small groups)

---- 

## Perception — Watchtower

The watchtower was important because it provided answers for important questions.

Remembering our former victories gives us clarity for present and future battles.

---- 

## Production — Winepress

The winepress can represent the uncomfortable places of our lives. 

When we are pressed something is always produced.

## What about casting stones away

The only way to pick up a stone is to stoop down.

Stoop down = humbling ourselves
