###### The Power of Harmony, with guest speaker: Josh Bourgeois

---- 

## Notes

Invest in people. Somebody’s freedom is waiting for your community. There’s a difference between unity and harmony. Unity is watching. Harmony is working together. Harmony bridges the gap between the people around you. The moment we remove ourselves from our community, we’re in trouble. “Now, the odds have changed.”

### Solitude is of God. Isolation is the enemy.
