# Cross Church Notes: April 10th, 2022

---- 

## What did I learn from today?

Get up. If I stay there, I’ll die there. 

Take control of the things that are holding you back. 

Be intentional. Bring people from outside the church. (Not just physical. What this means to me is to start sharing the notes again.)

Tell *your* story. Your friends don’t care about a God in a book. They want to know about a God in your life. 

Most people are not insulted when you include people in the things that are important to you.

## God of Miracles: The Greatest Miracle

- Luke 5:17-26
- 2 Peter 3:9
- 2 Timothy
- John 8:36
- Revelation 12:11

## When you encounter Jesus he speaks to what you need not what you want.

1. Get up
2. Get your stuff together
3. Go home

## How can I bring people to Jesus?

1. Start with compassion
2. Look for moments
3. Tell your story
4. Be bold
