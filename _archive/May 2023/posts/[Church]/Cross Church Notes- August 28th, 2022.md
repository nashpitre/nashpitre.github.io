---- 

## Pressure Points

We’re giving the enemy footholds because we’re holding onto anger.

You’ve never changed your mind after reading a Facebook post. 

Ask yourself: “Why am
I do confident in my side?”

---- 

## Anger and rest always at odds

It is not Godly for me to be angry. How this reads to me is: Get angry then get over it.

---- 

## Unoffendable People

1. Unoffendable people are free. 
2. Unoffendable people have better relationships. 
3. Unoffendable people choose to be that way.
