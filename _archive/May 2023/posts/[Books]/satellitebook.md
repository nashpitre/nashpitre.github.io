[When The Satellite Fell](satellite) was an album I released in 2020, quietly, before disappearing for about a year. Hardly speaking online about anything creative or about my personal life. The break was nice, but now I’m slowly finding new ways to be creative again. Turning this little album into a little book will be one of the projects I tackle. [Low hanging fruit](low-hanging-fruit). What can I build quickly that’ll help me rebuild momentum with creating again? Here’s a step in that direction.

## Empty Coordinates

This is Heaven. This is hell. This is Heaven. This is hell. When the satellite fell.

If I could get these thoughts out. Feels like I lost out. So many battles I fought now, I lost count. A lost child that found his way out of it. How did he? The route that he traveled was miles away. He saw the smoke and figured it was the right direction. Protection. The bodies were piled up like a mountain. He kept walking. The wisdom was self-taught. This music is brought to you by satellite signals with empty coordinates. The world was his orphanage. He kept walking with his Walkman. Bone Thugs and Harmony. He flipped the tape over, and hoped that it played over, and The double A batteries would last to the next shelter to help him. He was all by himself. A kid with a mission that was derailed by the military with mask, that scanned his face and told him he could pass. A distant future that resembles the past. He’s no different from you He’s just a few generations younger. The satellite above him let them know that he’s coming. Looking down from the stars. You can hear the sound of the war.

## Social Distance

> Is this progress? Is this nonsense? Is this progress? Is this nonsense?

This is what you need. This is what you need. Couple selfies, couple likes, that’s your company. The satellite signals we’re living underneath. They’re watching our location, that’s your company. Chasing after something that we wanna be. I just wanna breathe. I just wanna breathe. It’s hard to stay focused on what’s in front of me. All we’re seeing is the light glowing from the screen. Neon gods, look at what we done. Keep on scrolling, let’s keep it going. Our attention is what they feed on. Searching for freedom, so we share a meme with a quote and a meaning. Inspirational. You’re thinking you’re in control, while they’re pulling your strings. Every day is an algorithm repeating. Stop the bleeding. The monster is in the machine. Run.

> What is patience? I don’t have it. I embrace it. Gotta have it. This is racing. Who’s the fastest? While life is scrolling right past us. What is patience? I don’t have it. I embrace it. Gotta have it. This is racing. Who’s the fastest? While life is scrolling right past us.

## A Soldier’s Journey

When the satellite fell. In a land of no return. The heart was involved, but now there’s no concern. It’s a soldiers journey. The training has made me ambivalent to feelings, and your emotions aren’t part of the mission. If I left you behind, I apologize, but you just weren’t part of the vision that I was given.

It’s hard to be Christian in a world full of sickness. In a world full of hypocrites, I love you anyway. My best attribute is forgiveness. All you see is division. What a beautiful world that we live in, I think to myself, as I refill my prescription. Anxiety inside of me is now more like a friendship that I live with. Thousands of words have been written, just Look at the blisters. Every sentence collectively together tell a story of a person with wisdom. It’s like we’re sitting by the fire reading scriptures, as you quietly listen.

There’s a war in the distance. How did we get here? I call on higher powers to help me out, because I’m just one person trying to figure it out. How to take what I’m thinking, and make it more. From the floor plan, to the door handle: the blueprint’s laid out. This is I what I prayed about, and now it came about. It was written.

When The Satellite Fell. That title was created before the isolation. Before the quarantine. Before the social distance. Prophetic the way that the world crashed and caved in, and everyone stayed in their house, and kept to themselves. I wrote that title months before any of this, then the story wrote itself.

## Fearless

Fearless. Hope you hear this. I hope that whatever’s holding you back right now will disappear and you’ll begin a career with something that fulfills you. The wind is starting spiral. The mountain that was blocking your path is now gone. All that’s left is the road ahead of you. I know that you’re scared, I’m scared for you, but your legacy is there for you. Feel the momentum is pushing you forward. Clouds glowing, my body is floating. Levitating in a circular motion. A wizard with words, I’m now surging. I’m now a surgeon: open heart for you. Retractors, pealing back the layers. Don’t even feel like the same person.

I been working on myself. Not the music, but the music trails. Like a tail, like it’s cursive. You can see that I’ve been putting in the work. So observant. I’m more determined, more allergic to anything not moving me further. I’m on the verge of a breakthrough, as I pace through it. This is page 2 of your daily news. More like Pay-Per-View that you didn’t pay for. It’s all scrambled, and you can barely get a glimpse of me, but you can hear the intensity. This is meant for me. Feeling infinite. All those barriers the devil put in front of me didn’t even put a dent in me. Should’ve been done, but the hedge of protection was a fence for me. The rejuvenation is amazing. I mean look at me. Got that look in me. Got my book-bag full equipment. Ready for whatever. This is fun for me. Got my combat boots on. It’s only pair of shoes I wear. As I travel I’m prepared for war. Now I’m airborne. Coming down from the sky, fair warning. I’m the son of the sun, got the glair on me. Put your money on the table, it’s a gamble. Place your bet on me. I been gone for awhile, good morning.

## Generations

Find freedom in knowing you can’t be them, so you join them. The Art of War. Understanding  your enemy. Become a part of them, give your heart to them. Slowly they start to know you, then you defeat them. Satellite signals across the galaxy. I’m just doing God’s mission, how could you be mad at me? Been battling myself so long. I run circles around myself until the blur starts to look like another person. Whatever you want to do to hurt me. I’ve done trained in a dungeon, and slowly became the one you’re afraid to confront. Every page is another stage, another boss battle, a fight. It’s time to get it right. I’ve done simplified it all, and slowly became the light. My it brain operates in layers. It’s multifaceted. The accolades are accurate. Move with the mind of a Jedi: the ghost of Anakin. The swipe of a hand could change the atmosphere. It’s all practice here. Generations are waiting, I just do it for my family.

Dear Heavenly Father, we’re trying to follow you, but the satelllite got us, so get us out of here. We pray for forgiveness. Whatever we did, whatever they did—deliver us patience, as we’re changing.

## Family

Family. All of my love is inside of each one you. Memories of us together, the good and the bad. It’s nothing, it’s family. Family, you are my family. All of our differences don’t make us different, we’re family. This is the difference from difficult times, still giving my time. See you real soon. Love you from here to the moon, you’re family. Family, you are my family.

Whatever’s your struggle, your troubles, your past—let’s keep it between us. There’s freedom in knowing that nobody knows, but only your family. You are my family. People they come and they go, and Relationships ending with nothing but memories. Time to rebuild, but you still have your family. Family, you are my family. 

Living in bubbles. The world is in trouble, so huddle up close to your family. Fire between us is keeping us heated. No words are needed, silence between us, while thinking of all our seasons. I’m feeling your breathing. The flickers of light. This is our life. This is our family. This is my family.

## Stay Calm

Olivia:

> Pray and love with sincere feelings, with good works so that the world may change. 39 years down, 1 to go. Year 40, what will you bring? 

I guess this is what it’s come to. Our lifespan’s limited. Here you go, you’re losing your energy. When you realize you’re your worst enemy. Who will you run to? There’s a difference from: I need you, I want you. There’s people in your life that’ll come through—It’s a drive-by. They won’t stay long enough to matter. In your mind there’s a battle and it constantly haunts you. Stay calm through it.

Olivia:

> Will She go away? How much we have missed. We will be in lamentation. May You triumph soon, O Queen, bringing light into the darkness. I see beautiful and sad things. Reject every vice from your heart. Strive as much as possible. Only with Her help will we open our eyes. God sends you messages through men, nature, and so many things which can only help you to understand that you must.

Came a long way from where I’m at now. A boy in a black cloud, but he never backed down. In my mind there’s a packed crowd, but open my eyes and see nothing but the background. Guess I blacked out. Memories of nothing but a trap house, or a glass house. Look around and see who I am from all directions. When the satellite fell, I guess we lost connection. Friendships ending, I guess we lost respect. Then we moved on, but I stood there waiting. Maybe a glitch will fix what is breaking, and maybe you wouldn’t exit. But this is what I’m left with. Take the good with the bad, it’s all perspective.

When there trauma involved, it’s all mental health, and no matter how good life is—how many wins that you pile up, how many friends that you round up. At the end you’re just left with your vices, and all the ghosts in your devices, and who you played nice with. In the game of life, you roll the dice and hope they don’t swipe left. Attention spans last as fast as don’t blink twice. I’m trying to slow down, but my motorbike likes this. I fell down, but getting up’s where the light is. Another year, the wisdom is better here. 21 days of fasting, through magic I disappeared.
