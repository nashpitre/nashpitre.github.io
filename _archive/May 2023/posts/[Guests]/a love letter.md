# A Love Letter, or A Letter To Love

Always in my heart you make me feel more loved than I've ever felt, and happier than I've ever dreamed. The love and understanding you have is something I have searched for my entire life. Always in my happiest and saddest moments, you are my best friend and confidante. I come to you for everything, and you listen to me without judgment. Always, deep within my soul, I know we have a love like no other. What we share is something others only hope for and dream of, but few ever experience. Our love is magical beyond belief. Always, without hesitation, you give of yourself completely. You have reached the very depths of my soul, bringing out emotions I never knew I had, and unveiling an ability to love that I never thought possible. Always and forever you will be my dream come true, the one I have waited for all these years. From now until the end of time, I will love only you. We will be together always.

But, until that day; person; and love comes, I'll continue to hope, wish and pray to meet you. To awake (mentally, emotionally, spiritually & physically), to open my eyes and realize that dream has come true.
