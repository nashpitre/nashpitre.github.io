# The Beauty in the Long Road, by Alisha Autin

*Nash’s Note: Alisha’s guest post is about patience. We’re all so obsessed with instant gratification, but there’s beauty in the long road. The process. It’s hardly ever about what happens in the end. The process of getting there, though, is where life truly happens.*

How unfortunate it is to dwell in a world where quick fixes and easy way outs trump long-term hard work and seeing things to the finish. Where “Do what makes you happy,” holds priority over, “Do what is right.” We all desire to love and be loved, to experience endless joy, and to live in peace; however, we often forget that receiving these gifts requires taking the long journey with Jesus. When we walk with Him up the mountains, through the valleys, in many blessings, and among our most challenging trials; When we can feel His presence, and when we are not sure if He is there at all, this is when we find the beauty in the long road.

Although this walk is easier said than done, it is the only way. The one and only way we will have the slightest chance at receiving the deepest desires of our hearts. There is no alternate route or detour this world can offer that will compare to the journey that Jesus has prepared for each of us.

> **Galatians 5:22-23** “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things there is no law.”

Continue to take the long road, knowing that the best gifts in life will be waiting at the end.
