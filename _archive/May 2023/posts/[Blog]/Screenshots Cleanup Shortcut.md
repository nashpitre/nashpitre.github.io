I made a simple shortcut to deal with all the screenshots I take. Before, I had hundreds floating around, junking up my Photos app.

With this shortcut, it takes all the screenshots, sends them to a folder in iCloud to archive, and then deletes them from the Photos app. I didn’t want to just delete them completely, because that would make me second guess pressing this shortcut.

Having a screenshot archive folder that they’re sent to and removed from the Photos app is the best of both worlds. Cleans up photos and stores them somewhere safe just in case I might’ve needed something that I never got a chance to review.
