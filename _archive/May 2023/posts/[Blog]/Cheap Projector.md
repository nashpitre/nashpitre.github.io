# Life Hack: Buy a Cheap Projector for Outside

One of my favorite recent purchases is a [cheap projector from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JQ8YT36?ref=ppx%5C_pop%5C_mob%5C_ap%5C_share) to put in my backyard. It was under $100. It’s not the best quality (I think 720p), and what’s playing can only be seen when it gets dark outside. But when the sun starts to go down, the ambience immediately changes.
