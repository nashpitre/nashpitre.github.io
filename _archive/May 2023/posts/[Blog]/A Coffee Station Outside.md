# A Coffee Station Outside

![](https://i.imgur.com/httHAXx.jpg)

One of the first areas in my house that I setup was a coffee station outside. I wake up at 5 am, come outside and get the coffee started without ever going into the kitchen. Since day one here, that’s been my morning ritual.

I wanted the old fashion coffee pot that I didn’t have to think about. I could walk over to get a refill and it’ll still be hot. Just enough of a process to enjoy and to keep it fresh, but not too complicated. I chose this route over the Keurig, the AeroPress, and the French Press for this reason.

Once the coffee is made, I’ve already had a bottle of water, and my writing process has already started. When I take my first break from typing, I’ll start pouring my coffee, and getting back to writing [until the sun comes up](rts).
