# Make Your Own Impact

Too many people are watching. Scrolling. Responding/reacting. Defense. 

Few are on offense/doing something. It’s easy to reply. Try being the one that they reply to. 

You’re playing it safe, while still having an opinion about everything. With no action.

Make your own impact.
