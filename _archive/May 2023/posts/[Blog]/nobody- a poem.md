# Nobody: a poem

Stranger to stranger, the differences are small. Love, pain, anger, and fear, I want it all. Nobody. Capturing a smile, and documenting the hurt. My observations become obsessions, I make it work.

I care about you, but I barely know you, is that enough? A scavenger hunt, finding you, that diamond in the rough. A blank face (nobody), replaced with yours, when we're acquainted. Your eyes tell a story of redemption, we see you've made it. Memories is all we have, silhouettes, they disappear. In exchange for somebody that's here. Embrace fear.

A friendship, endearment, what you're hearing is a poem. Nobody. When the story becomes you, and you are someone that's so important. You bring clarity to the distortion. A small portion.
