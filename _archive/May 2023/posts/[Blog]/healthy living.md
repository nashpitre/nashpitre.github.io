For the first few weeks of 2018, I’ve been consistently eating healthy (salads and smoothies) and filling my Apple Watch rings (burning tons of calories with running and basketball). I’m noticing how much of an impact it has on my mind: I’m much sharper, I’m more content, and way more productive when I feel healthy.

As much as I love pasta and pizza (and everything else out there that’s delicious, but bad for me), I hate the way I feel (and look) after eating it. I used to be able to eat anything and it would have no effect on me, but that’s not the case anymore. I’ve learned to be mindful of what goes into my body, as well as the amount of exercising I should do each day. 

This is just the beginning. This isn’t a season or a phase. This is a lifestyle change. It’s a process of discipline and education, as I continue to find ways to improve my health.

I hope you’ll join me.
