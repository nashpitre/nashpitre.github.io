# Back to Dropbox: Organizing My Digital Files

I tried to move on from Dropbox, hopefully simplifying what services I use: since I already use iCloud for photos and certain apps on my phone, I thought I could get by with using iCloud to replace Dropbox too, this was a huge mistake. iCloud Drive is nowhere near ready for this type of task, maybe for some people, who don't have many files to store, but for me, it caused confusion and clutter, and completely went against what I was aiming for. So, I went back to Dropbox, and I'm excited to have all of my files organized again, even *more* organized than before I left, since I've learned more about what works and what doesn't.
