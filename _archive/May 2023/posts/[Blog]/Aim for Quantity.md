# Aim for Quantity

I learned many years ago, that the best way to create, is to create a lot. Create and don’t look back. Quality will arrive in due time if the quantity is there. More swings at bat. More shot attempts. Document don’t create. The volume that I produce will ultimately result in more ideas, more creations to refer back to, and more of a database for myself to use for bigger projects. Most big projects are an accumulation of dozens of little projects. Everything was a spec that transformed into a hundreds specs, that looks like a well-thought out plan.

Don’t underestimate what showing up every day looks like.
