# Doing More and Not Settling

Friend:

> I just wanna live a life I love. I don't like limits. I love my life. I'm grateful for it every day. I just want to do more and not settle.

The desire for **more** is something we all think of. We look at our life, and we think, “There has to be more.”

And there is.

- First, it starts with **perspective**. Changing the way we look at our everyday life. It’s easy to get sucked into the motions of a day. Bouncing around from one mundane task to the next. That same exact day that you’re mindlessly going through could be filled with so much more, *just* by understanding that our mind controls it all.

- Second, creating **white space**. Buffers. Those mundane task that *have* to get done, don’t let your schedule stick together so much, where there’s no white space in between. Leave space between everything in your day, where there’s no rushing, where there’s room to be creative, room to think, and room to breathe. **Leave room for life to happen**.

- Third, be **intentional**. Think about it this way: if you could wake up every day, with a complete blank canvas, to do anything in the world that you want, what would you do? What kind of person would you be if you had more time? What would you accomplish?

Now, through perspective, through white space, and through being intentional, the world is yours, with no limits. Whatever you want to do, do it.
