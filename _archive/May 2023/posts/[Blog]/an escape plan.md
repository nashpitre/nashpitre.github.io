# An Escape Plan

I have an escape plan. Not a weekend or a week, but a whole month...maybe even a year. No agenda, nowhere to be, no tasks to complete. I would leave all electronic devices behind. Except for my Kindle Paperwhite. It would be me, my boots, my backpack, and my bike. The backpack would consist of a few black shirts, a jacket, a few pairs of socks and boxers. A notebook. A pen. My Field Pocket (hygiene bag). My water bottle. My thermos. And after packing, the escape plan would begin. The main focus would be the Kindle Paperwhite and all the books inside of it that are waiting to be read. I would simply vanish into words.
