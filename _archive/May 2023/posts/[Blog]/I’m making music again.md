# I’m making music again

After a two year break, I’m finally making music again. I have a concept in mind for the project. I bought a new [microphone](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTA5MTkzNDU1NTE3NTc4?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) and started chipping away immediately. 

I’m at nine drafts so far:

- [Four](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTYxMzAzMTMwNTg5NzQ3?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) on March 30th
- Two on April 7th
- Three on April 11th

One of the songs from last night might have a feature on it, thanks to serendipity.
