# A Few Podcast Recommendations

I listen to so many podcast. It's basically playing in my ear all day. My friend just asked for some podcast recommendations, so I figured I'd gather some of the best that I know to help her out.

---- 

## Hereâ€™s the kind she was looking for:

> I love to learn about anything, but people and cultures are my favorite. inspirational, stories, Christian, health and wellness, etc.

---- 

As I was making this list, I recommended she download The [Overcast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast/id888422857) app, which I consider the best way to experience podcasts.

---- 

## Here's a few that came to mind:

- The Watch
- The Ground Up Show
- Revisionist History
- Dream Big Podcast
- Hello Internet
- The Minimalist Podcast
- On Margins
- The Porch
- The Daily
- GaryVee Audio Experience (explicit)
- Encounter [^1]
- The Jordan Harbinger Show
- This American Life
- Today, Explained

---- 

I could make a list much longer than this, but these match some of the criteria's she was looking for.

[^1]:	Harder to find because of the generic name. Here's what it looks like.
