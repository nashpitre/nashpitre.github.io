# No Phone (Lasted 22 Days)

As I was pricing professional cameras, and comparing the quality of what each one would give me (the one I wanted was around $1,500) — and as I was looking at the price of the new iPhone SE ($399), the best camera for the best price was actually an iPhone. So, unfortunately, the experiment is over.

### 22 days. No phone.

I sold an iPhone 11 Pro, paid it off, and now have a $400 phone that delivers similar qualify of that iPhone 11, just in an older casing, and more than half the price. This new SE is fascinating and should be considered by more people (they see the old body style and think it’s an old phone, not realizing it’s more powerful than most phones), because of what you're getting for this price, in terms of performance and camera quality is incredible.
