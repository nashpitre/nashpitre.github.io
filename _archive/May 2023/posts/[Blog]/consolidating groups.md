# Consolidating Groups

![](https://i.imgur.com/F4atZ0i.jpg)

If you’ve been recently added to this [Creative Minds](facebook.com/groups/288029324892997) group, it’s because you were previously in one of my other small groups, and I’m consolidating them all into this one. With that being said, you’re welcome to leave the group. No hard feelings. I understand.

All of my small groups have had similar themes: be creative and have fun. They’ve all had different names and different Facebook groups, but they’ve basically all been the same. So as I gear up to start leading small groups again, I wanted to first clean house, and simplify what it’ll look like going forward.

Whether it’s a basketball group, a coffee shop group, a bbq group, or a doodle group, it’s all [Creative Minds](facebook.com/groups/288029324892997).
