##### [Happy Scale](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/happy-scale/id532430574)

I’ve been consistent with running every day, logging weight, and logging food. The month is almost over, and I’m happy with how I feel. Off to a great start.

## The [shop](shop) is open again

The [shop](shop) page is back again, with a variety of ways to support the site. Lots of merchandise and exclusives. I’ll be focused on expanding this more throughout Q1.

## Games I’m about to complete

I’m almost finished with two of my favorite games on the PS5: Kena feels like a Pixar movie that I get to control, and It Takes Two is the best co-op game I’ve ever played.

With It Takes Two, I get to play it with my sister as we think through problems (until my brain breaks and I have to turn it off for the day).

Gonna miss playing these two games.

## Plans for this week

A lot of running. A lot of drawing and learning Procreate (more on this soon).  I’m on 24/7 noonie and diaper duty. I also plan to do some remodeling on the house. Overall, it should be a nice productive week.
