The title says it all. Each day, when you open the iPad, it’s already there. You immediately have the New York Times cover as the background of your iPad, allowing you to glimpse at today’s big stories.

Just by using this [shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/24e3e76d40884c428b49e19baa0d38f4).

Next up is to create the morning automation. That way when you wake up and the wallpaper is already set.

Opening up my iPad in the morning shows me the big headlines, without me ever having to open an app.
