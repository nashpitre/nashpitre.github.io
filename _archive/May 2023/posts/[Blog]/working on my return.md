# Working On My Return

I feel inspiration creeping back in. After a rough month, everything is beginning to become stable again, and I'm excited about the upcoming projects I'll be working on.

Confidence is better than it's been all month, peace has been restored, and just by going through my normal routines, negative thoughts were slowly flushed out. I didn't have to recreate the environment around me, I just had to be patient and let time run its course.
