# A Season of Transition (what I’ve been up to)

## Create

I’m finishing up my first book, and gathering more pieces for the two books that’ll follow. It’s been 10 years in the making, but soon, I’ll be able to call myself an author. (I’m also in the beginning phase of starting a new album.)

## Personal

Meditation, solitude, reading, and basketball. I’ve been keeping to myself a lot in this season, but that alone time has been therapeutic for me. The next season involves a lot of community, so I’m enjoying the solitude while I can.

## Work

I have two new jobs. Both allow me to travel a lot. One is out of town traveling, and the other is local traveling and delivering. One requires me to dress formal and sit at a desk, while the other requires me to wear a lime green shirt, and I show up at people’s doorstep. Both keep me busy.
