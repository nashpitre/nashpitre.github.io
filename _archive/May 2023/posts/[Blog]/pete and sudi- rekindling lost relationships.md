# Pete and Sudi: Rekindling Lost Relationships

![](/_photos/oris.jpg)

It's been 12 years since I last seen my aunt and uncle. Time moves fast: years slip by, and then a decadeâ€”and then one day you wake up missing someone, wondering how did that much time get in the way of your relationship.

Last night, I surprised My Uncle Pete and my Aunt Sudi while they were performing at The Jolly In. They were both in awe to see me, and our conversations were effortless. It'll be a night I never forget, and I believe we'll now have a thriving relationship.

If there's someone in your life that you've lost touch with, reach out to them before it's too late.
