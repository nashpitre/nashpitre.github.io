# Neophile: A new word that I just learned, that maybe helps me understand myself better

While reading a book, I came across a word that I never heard, and had to look it up. “Neophiliac”. After looking through its Wikipedia, there’s a lot of things here that relate to me. It’s kind of scary.

---- 

## Neophiles/Neophiliacs have the following basic characteristics

- The ability to adapt rapidly to extreme change.

- A distaste or downright loathing of tradition, repetition, and routine.

- A tendency to become bored quickly with old things.

- A desire, bordering on obsession in some cases, to experience novelty.

- A corresponding and related desire to create novelty by creating or achieving something and/or by stirring social or other forms of unrest.

- A complete objection to or distrust of commitment.
