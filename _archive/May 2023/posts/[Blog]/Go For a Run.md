Now that I have a [house](wbah), I also have a neighborhood, and I can finally do something I’ve always wanted to do. 

Run.

Running my neighborhood is something I look forward to doing consistently. Through the neighborhood, to the coffee shop, exploring different routes. All from just leaving my house now. That’s the beauty of living near the downtown area of my city.

Between running, walking Jedi, and [playing basketball at my new court](mobc), I should be exercising a lot more. I’ve been thinking about it since work last night. Waking up and running. As soon as I’m done writing this, I’ll be starting today’s run through the neighborhood, to the coffee shop.
