# Sometimes we earn the day, sometimes we sit on the couch

This picture showed up in my email today. [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com/about/), the guys who made this, takes a newspaper and blacks out everything but the story he wants to tell.

> Sometimes we earn the day...

The phrase "earn the day" caught my attention. How can I earn my day, both at AT&T and on my site? Am I doing what I can to earn this current day? Did I earn yesterday?

Lately, I know I have earned my day creatively and at my church. I've been pouring into both more than I ever have. And unfortunately, because of this, my work at AT&T has been slacking. My day job is what pays the bills, so you would think I'd be completely focused on it, but I seem to get comfortable and go through the motions. I haven't been earning my day there.

> Sometimes we sit on the couch.

It's important for me to give each day everything I have and not be complacent. I have all the tools that I could possibly need: a great paying job, a vehicle, a website, an iPad, a microphone. There's no reason why I can't earn my day. From when I wake up until I close my eyes, my goal is to *earn the day*.

Side note: I love Austin Kleon's book, [Steal Like An Artist](http://austinkleon.com/steal/). Highly recommend it.
