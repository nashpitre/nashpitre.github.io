#### Step 1: Decision

### The decision to say goodbye to my car on the left, to get the car on the right. It took a lot of decisions to make this happen.

#### Step 2: Freedom

### This is what freedom looks like. It’s old and loud and beautiful and paid off. The amount of money I’m saving per month now is incredible.

#### Step 3: What’s Next

### A Grom for everyday. The little green car will be for rainy days.
