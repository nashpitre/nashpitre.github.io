# Ending My Daily Thanks

### What are three things you're [thankful](thanks) for today?

June 14th will make three months since I started [The Thankful Project](thanks). June 21st will make 100 days. That'll be the last day I write these. Itâ€™s a good stopping point. 100 days, multiplied by three thanks per day, equals a [book](books).
