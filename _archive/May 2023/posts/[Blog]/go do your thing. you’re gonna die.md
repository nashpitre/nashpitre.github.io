May 1st. This is exciting. Each month gives us a fresh start. We have a blank canvas to build the life we want. Right now. I’ve been up since 5 am, finishing up on a project that I’ve been working on for a few weeks now. “Go do your thing. You’re gonna die.” Those two sentences remind me that time is limited. Stop wasting it.
