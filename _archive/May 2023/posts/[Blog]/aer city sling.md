# Aer City Sling

Sometimes a backpack is too much. Sometimes leaving the house doesn’t require you to take all your possessions with you like I usually do. That’s where this Aer City Sling comes in. Keys, charger, AirPods, wallet, GoPro, Kindle, Field Notes, pen. That’s what’s currently inside of the sling. It goes over one shoulder and attaches to me at angle, with all of my gear behind me as I’m riding the motorcycle. Think of Trunks, my favorite superhero, and his sword that slings over his shoulder, as he arrives from the future. That’s me and this little sling. There’s not much saving or killing I’ll be doing here though. I’ll probably just read you a book.
