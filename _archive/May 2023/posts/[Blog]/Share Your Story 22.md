# Share Your Story

#### Season 2 is gearing up now. If you have a story you’d like to share: [Get in touch](mailto:%20nashp@me.com).

It’s been on my heart lately to get more people involved again. A couple of years ago, I gathered over 25 people to tell their stories. Testimonies, thoughtful reflections, and creative insights. It was beautiful thing to see. Now I’m looking to bring that back. 

At [nashp.com/guest](guest), you can see and read all of Season 1. With Season 2, I already have a dozen people prepped and ready to share something that’s important to them. 

If you know anyone interested, or if you’d like to share  your own story, [get in touch with me](mailto:%20nashp@me.com). These simple guest post are one of the most popular things on nashp.com, even after all these years. I’m hoping you’ll join us.
