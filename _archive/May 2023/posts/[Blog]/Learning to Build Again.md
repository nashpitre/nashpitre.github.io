# Learning To Build Again

![](https://i.imgur.com/2GYHsta.jpg)

I’m learning how to build again. Taking time off from creating isn’t always the best decision. Turning that switch back doesn’t happen instantly. I’ve spent half a year now finding myself again with creativity. As my life changed around me, it caused me to go through an identity crisis as an artist.

I made the decision recently that the only way to get back to myself was to simplify and starts chipping away. Whatever building looks like with that specific topic, make a mess with that idea — don’t  overthink it, don’t worry about how the finish product will look, just get the thoughts out. Find joy in climbing the mountain again.

Keep building. I remember what it’s like when I had the momentum. It motivates me to build until I’m there again.
