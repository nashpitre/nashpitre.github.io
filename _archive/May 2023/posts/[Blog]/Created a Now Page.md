Today was the release of two posts: 

- “[Now](https://nashp.com)” page
- About “Now” page

A now page was popularized by one of my favorite writers and thinkers, [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/now). It tells the story of what you’re currently up to.

I wanted to make this page to replace my homepage of October, the [one](1021) that showed all the posts I’ve written this month. I’m preparing for the month to be over, and the creating something every day to end. This is that first step.
