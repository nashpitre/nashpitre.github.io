# Low Hanging Fruit

Planning to write some bigger posts. I have ideas for larger projects, but I think the key right now is to tackle all the low hanging fruit. Practice getting back into the swing of things and make small posts about current things in my life. Like [Jedi](jedi-our-siberian-husky). Or the [PS5](playstation-5). More like gathering the resources publicly than in the background.
