I stumbled upon Blot a few days ago. I've been rebuilding my site to work on it ever since. It checks off everything I want in a blogging platform, mainly allowing me to do these two things really well:

1. Write from iPhone
2. Manage and run from Dropbox

A bonus that I wasn't expecting: just by adding a YouTube link to my writing, it transforms into the actual video for you to watch.

Here's to new inspiration and easy blogging. Thanks, [David](http://twitter.com/davidmerfieid).
