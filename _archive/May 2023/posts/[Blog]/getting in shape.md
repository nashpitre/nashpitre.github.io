# Getting in Shape

My daily lifestyle has changed a lot over the years. Because of lack of time, lower metabolism, etc.â€”it's been much harder for me to stay in shape. I don't do the New Years Resolution thing like most people, but since this year started, I've been privately pushing myself to get into the best shape of my life. I've been waking up a few hours early (5am to be exact), to run, play basketball, or workout.

And for the past few days, I've been doing [P90X3](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/p90x3-workout.do), a 30 minute workout, with videos to follow along to. This has been a helpful (and painful) starter-kit for me. But I'm confident that after this 90 day schedule, I'll have created good habits to workout without needing those videos.

If you have tips or would like to join me on this journey, please, get in touch.
