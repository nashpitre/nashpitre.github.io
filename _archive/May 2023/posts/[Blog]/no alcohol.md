# Three Years, No Alcohol

It was three years ago when I last tasted alcohol. It feels weird to have this milestone, because I never had a problem with drinking. There’s people out there that struggle with this. I’m not one of them. The decision I made back then was less about sobriety and more about character building. I simply knew that it didn’t fit into the plans I have for my life. Three years later, that decision seems so obvious now: although minor to someone who was only a social drinker, it’s those little decisions multiplied over days and years that create the person I ultimately want to be. This milestone, alongside all the other milestones I've created for myself, serve as a reminder to just keep going. It's that simple.
