# Start a Fire

![]()

Start a fire. Wherever you are. Whatever season you’re in. Whatever you’re going through. Good or bad. You have an opportunity to turn darkness into light. To bring warmth to those who need it most. You may even need it yourself. So start a fire. This will give the world a smoke signal to find you. This will let those that are lost see that there’s help out there, if they just follow the smoke and begin moving in that direction, to safety.

Or you might be the one alone, and you’re the one needing the help. The smoke signal will bring that help. The rescue team will be there shortly. Just start a fire.
