# The Best Man’s Speech

*Here’s the speech I gave at my cousin’s wedding:*

> Shaun,
> 
> I want to thank you. I always want to thank you. Growing up, you taught me everything: how to be a better brother to your sisters, a better son to your mom, a better basketball player, and as my manager, you taught me how to be a better employee. I’ve looked up to you for what feels like my entire life. I wanted to be like you, which helped me become a better person in every way. So it’s only fitting that you’re getting married before me, to show me how to be a husband.
> 
> You taught me how to expect more from myself, and how to not give up. Those are two things needed in a marriage for it to thrive. Continue being the best version of yourself. Your family deserves it. And when the bad days arrive, as they always do, you’ll know what to do next: you won’t give up.
> 
> It’s an honor to be your best man.
