14 for 14. I’ve shown up every morning for two weeks to release something to the world. Not everything I released was a hit, but the only metric I cared about was showing up. I still have two more weeks to go to complete this project.

This is a two week check in. The hardest part is actually just waking up early enough to do it. There were a few days where I overslept by 30 minutes, and by doing this, the rest of the family was up while I was still writing, making it much harder to finish.

Having a two-hour block of time to create is the goal. 5 to 7. That’s enough time to write something new, finish something old, and release something to the world.
