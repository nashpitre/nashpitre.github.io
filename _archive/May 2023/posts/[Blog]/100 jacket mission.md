# 100 Jacket Mission

![](https://i.imgur.com/B2eSgo1.jpg)

How lucky we are to open up our closets, try on several jackets (hardly liking any of them) and still walk away not 100% satisfied with what we're wearing. We take for granted the choices we have in our wardrobe: do I want to be warm, do I want to be warm, or do I want to be warm? When you remove the luxury of style, that's the only thing left. That jacket—the one that we've tried on dozens of times, but have yet to find the perfect outfit to wear it with—could be the one thing keeping someone from being cold this winter. How it looks on them is irrelevant, they just want to be warm.

*This is the 6th Annual 100 Jacket Mission. [Get in touch](mailto:nashp@me.com) if you’d like to donate.*
