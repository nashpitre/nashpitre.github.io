# My Cracked Apple Pencil

My Apple Pencil cracked in my bag awhile back, and something cool happened since then:

- I’ve been more careful and mindful of where it’s at throughout the day.
- I’ve been brainstorming creative ways to repair it.
- I stopped looking at it as this perfect object.
- I decided to add super glue, and then electric tape to the cracked area.
- I’m now in love with the character that this flawed object now has.
