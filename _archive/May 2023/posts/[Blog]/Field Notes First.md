# Field Notes First (and stickers)

I used my Field Notes a lot this week. The goal is to write in there all week, then return here on Mondays with those thoughts. Things that I write about here, should be coming from some quick notes I wrote in Field Notes. That’s the goal.

Jotting it down there to refer to later is a great way to keep things flowing. Not having to be on my phone. Being away from screen.

It also allows me to think deeper about ideas, instead of writing the full paragraph in that moment. 

I recently bought stickers to fill in the gaps that are left on random pages. It’s brought these little notebooks to life.
