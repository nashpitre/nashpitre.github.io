# It’s a Girl

Yesterday, with only 5 weeks left, we had our baby shower. It was a shower, gender reveal, *and* announcement (to the online world). It was refreshing keeping this private for so long.

We did a basketball shot clock countdown, with dunk to reveal.

I celebrated all last night by drinking Crown Royal Vanilla, with music playing from the TV, while setting up the Roomba.

Now, with just a little over a month left before the baby’s here, it’s time to get this house ready for one more.
