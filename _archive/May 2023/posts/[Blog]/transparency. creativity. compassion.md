# Transparency. Creativity. Compassion

Transparency. Creativity. Compassion. A combination of being vulnerable, but also being a beacon of light, sums up this new version of myself.

On nashp.com, I've setup a schedule button for anyone to have coffee, work on something creative, or just wants to hangout with me. It's connected my calendar and shows any hour I'm free in the next 30 days. I'm being very intentional about growing my relationship with those around me, with anyone that wants to pour into my life, or anyone that needs help and wants me to pour into theirs.

Through a season of anxiety and weakness, I've become stronger than ever before, transforming the old prideful, reclusive version of myself, into a more vibrant, curious, and expressive one. There's so much power in showing the world your heart. People are craving something real. I've been reminded constantly by a little voice in my head: through the good times and the bad, be the light.

(“I'm not enough. Unless you come. Will you meet me here again.”)
