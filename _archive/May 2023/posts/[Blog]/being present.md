# Being Present

![](https://i.imgur.com/9MFW8bI.jpg)

Time. Before and after this very moment doesn't matter. Stay focused on right now. Stay present.

Disappointment ï¿¼is the result of unmet expectations that were most likely only created in our mind. It never really existed. It was an illusion. 

Disappointment tends to live in that before-and-after time. Not in the now. So stay present and become grounded on what's currently in front of you. The water. The paper. The book. The boat. The tree. Focus on what you see and what you can control, nothing else. The rest isn't up to you anyway.
