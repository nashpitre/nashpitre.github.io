This message is for those coming from my [mailing list](mc). I just turned it back on for the new year. I explained why [here](mc):

> The last one was sent almost two years ago. I paused it because I knew that I wouldn’t be creating as much for awhile, and I didn’t want to send emails with little value. I’m turning it back on because it’s opposite now. The content is flowing again. This is your way to keep up with the site.

It’s been awhile. [^1]

In 2020, I released a book, three new [albums](music), and a handful of videos. But then I got quiet. I was busy resetting my life. Busy starting a family. 

All the major links that explain what I’ve been up to are at the bottom of this page (right underneath my cartoon face), so be sure to click through those. That’s the quickest way to see the highlights.

## Document, don’t create.

Document, don’t create. That’s why I’m back writing again. Not because I’m ready to create, but because I’m ready to document. Creating is the byproduct of me documenting and experimenting.

## Get in touch

If you come across something that you enjoy or want to expand on, get in touch with me: by replying to the email, or messaging me on social. 

Let’s have a conversation about some random topic that you found on this site.
