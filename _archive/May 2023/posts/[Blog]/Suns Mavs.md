# Suns lose to Mavs Twice (series is now tied 2-2)

![][image-1]

[Last time I wrote][1] something about the Suns, they were tied with the Pelicans, at 2-2. It happened again here with the Mavericks: after two losses in Dallas, the Suns are once again in a series tied 2-2.

These last two games were horrible for the Suns, especially for Chris Paul: Game 3 was all turnovers, Game 4 was foul trouble and being fouled out, causing him to barely play.

The Suns definitely have to play better, and I have complete confidence that they will. They’re the better team, they just haven’t shown it on the road. I fully expect a dominant performance tomorrow night in Phoenix, putting the Suns one game away from moving on to the Conference Finals.

Anyone panicking hasn’t seen this team’s resilience all year.
