# Just tell a story

I show up daily with a simple plan to tell a story. It’s therapeutic for myself, giving me an outlet for my thoughts, while at the same time, hopefully, helping someone else with something they’re struggling with, or maybe inspire them to move forward with their own thoughts and ideas. Sometimes, the story is loved. Sometimes, it hears crickets. Either way though, the story is the story, and the amount of attention it receives never takes priority over the creation of it. It arrives in many shapes and sizes. Whether it's a paragraph, a song, a picture, or a video, the goal is always the same each morning: just tell a story. With that simple plan in mind, I believe that I can leave the world better than how it was the day before.
