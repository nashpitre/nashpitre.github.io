# I now have my own basketball court

Where I moved to, there’s a basketball court the next block over. I can almost see it from my front door. It was one of the main reasons I considered this house.

Basketball has been a part of my life since elementary school, and even at 35, I don’t see it going away anytime soon. It’s what keeps me in shape. Keeps me competitive. Keeps me having fun. 

But it did start becoming harder to find the time and place to play it consistently. That’s why living this close to a court won’t be taken for granted. It’s just a decision now, instead of a variety of other obstacles.

A few days ago, I bought some new nets for the goals, then my brother and dad came help me put them up. We backed the truck up to the court and removed what was left of some chain nets.

It’ll be important for me to take care of these goals and treat them like my own, because I know what it’s like to live without them.
