# My Nanny Sheila

My Nanny Sheila has always been an important person in my life. At times, when the world would get hectic for me, her simple, calm personality would be my rock to escape to. We all have that one person in our family that understands us more than anyone else, and for me, that's my Nanny.

Many things that you see in me, are things that she's taught me through her own life. Consistency and gracefully living are two of the main ones: you can be the person that switches lanes eight times to get to the red light, or you can enjoy the lane you're currently in, and without rushing, still beat the person that was speeding through traffic. That's my Nanny Sheila. 

I'm thankful for her guidance through moments of confusion.
