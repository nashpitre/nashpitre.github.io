# My Grandma’s Birthday

![](https://i.imgur.com/knuznvp.jpg)

Today is my grandma’s birthday. I wish she was still around to meet Rose. She would’ve loved her. She would’ve drove all the way down from Arkansas to meet her. A lot of people say that Rose looks like her, and that’s the best compliment I can think of for my baby. I just hope she has my grandma’s heart too. The resemblance will be a constant reminder to teach Rose that same kindness. I love you Carol. Sleep well.
