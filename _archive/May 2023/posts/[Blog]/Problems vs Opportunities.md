It’s easy to complain and stress about things that happen to us. That’s our natural reaction. Reflecting on life recently helped me understand something that I could start doing to improve this.

Every situation gives me a choice: I can complain about new problems, or, instead, I can look at these situations as new opportunities to grow. Instead of seeing setbacks, I can see them as moments to gain knowledge. 

Each moment that I feel myself wanting to complain about, I can try to shift my thinking to curiosity and eagerness to learn. 

What are some areas that are on my mind right now that I can apply this? Immediately, I should feel better about my day.
