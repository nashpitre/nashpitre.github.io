After being silent for almost five years, on August 20th of last year, Kendrick shared some [thoughts](https://oklama.com/nuthoughts) and announced his album is on the way: 

> I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.
> 
> I go months without a phone.
> 
> Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family.
> 
> While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.
>  
> As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continue to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid creators. As I continue to pursue my life’s calling.
> 
> There’s beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.
> 
> Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I’ve prayed for you all.
> 
> See you soon enough.
>

## Oklama

Everything that I’ve shared so far from the album, Kendrick signs off as “Oklama” instead of Kendrick. Cole breaks down maybe why:

[^1]:	I don’t get to do this as much anymore, thanks to mediocre music being released nowadays. I forgot how refreshing this is to watch a rollout done the right way.
