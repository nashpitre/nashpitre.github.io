# Iterate To The Next Level

I keep adding new layers to my site. I’ve been really inspired to build out new expressions and personalities that are sprinkled around my content. I’m not afraid to add these layers and then draw them back a bit in the future. I believe it’s all bringing me to a place that could be considered a next level. I think back of where my site was a year ago, five years ago, a decade ago...I wouldn't be where I’m at now without those iterations. Too many people wait for the big changes. Iterations over days and years is how you get to your best self.
