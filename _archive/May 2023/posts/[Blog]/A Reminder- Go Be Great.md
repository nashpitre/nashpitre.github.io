# A Reminder: Go Be Great

![](https://imgur.com/Xe0Klji.jpg)


This is your reminder. It’s pretty simple. Go be great. Stop overthinking. Your mind: it’s special. You have ideas and thoughts that set you apart from everyone around you. The things you see. About your family. About yourself. About your job. About your finances. About your future.

Take action on these thoughts. Don’t let them just sit in your mind. That’s a graveyard up there for ideas that’ll never happen. When you feel inspired, attack it like the clock is running out, because you only have a brief moment with that light before it passes.

Just go. Stop planning. Start doing. Stop waiting for life to happen, and instead, make it happen. You’re gonna fall. You might even fail. Who cares. People are too busy with their own lives to notice all the details of your evolution. Take these moments and grow more than you have in years. And through all of this uncertainty, there will be small wins, and evenutally, you’ll find yourself doing something incredible.

Now, back to this big project I’m working on.
