# What do you do for work?

What do you do for work? We all come from different walks of life, learning different sets of skills, and these skills help us pay all of our expenses and bills each month. Whether we’re doing our job because we love it, or simply because it's keeping the lights on and food on the table — either way, it's part of our identity. (Maybe you’re in-between jobs and are currently unemployed. I hope this post serves as inspiration for what’s next.)

Do you consider this a career or a temporary job? Are you passionate about where you’re working now? And if you wouldn't be doing this job, and you could instead do anything in the world, what would that be? Is it possible to start making this transition now or very soon? Whether you reply directly, or you think these thoughts to yourself, the main point is this: what does your future look like?
