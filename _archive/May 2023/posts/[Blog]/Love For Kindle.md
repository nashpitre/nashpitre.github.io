# My Love For Kindle

I’ve had a Kindle for years. I can’t remember how long I’ve had one, but I’m guessing close to a decade. A few time in between—when getting a new shiny iPad—I would sell my Kindle, thinking I wouldn’t need it anymore. Shortly after, when I’d crave reading a book and researching, I knew what was missing. The Kindle. 

The removal of any distractions when there’s just a book. The e-ink screen that lasts weeks. The sharp text in sunlight. The infinite amount of books with me at all times. All of this together is a simple reminder that I’m just a few paragraphs away from my next insight. My next breakthrough.
