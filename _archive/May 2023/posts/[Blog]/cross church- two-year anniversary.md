Cross Church has only been around for a total of three years, but today (January 28th, 2017) marks the two-year anniversary for me attending. The first time I went, they were in a movie theatre: it was so unique and refreshing, and ironically, the message was on raising money, so they could have their own church. Some people would be turned off by this as their first impressionâ€”but for me, and with Pastor Brandon's sincerity and vision, I walked in on something that felt big for our community. Vision means everything to me, and I gravitate towards people that try to see further than only what's in front of them. Immediately, Pastor Brandon Bilbo was someone I admired and looked up to. His humility, humor, and stage presence pulled me in, and even to someone that barely went to church before, I haven't looked back since.

My first day attending Cross Church was only meant to be a one-time supportive gesture to a friend who asked me to join him, as he had just gotten out of rehab, but that one day changed the entire trajectory of my life. Cross Church is a combination of knowledge, peace, joy, and relationships that are second to none, and I'm excited to know that this is only the beginning.
