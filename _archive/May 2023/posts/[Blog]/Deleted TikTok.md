# I deleted my TikTok account

The dopamine. The constant scrolling. The half naked girls. The never ending cycle for my attention. 

Even though I know the trend is heading towards that being the future, it was too loud. I had nothing in common with it, and it brought me more exhaustion than enjoyment. (Not to mention seeing people I know act weird just to cater to the latest trends on the platform). I’ll happily step away from all of that. 

Letting it go was one of the easiest decisions I’ve ever made.
