- **Teach Me How To Doodle (And Dinner)**: Every other Sunday, a group of us will be getting together to cook dinner (Heather) and attempt to doodle (me). Join [here](https://m.facebook.com/groups/1458075627615652).

- **No Tellin' Tuesdays**: Me and my friend Janea will be leading a group on Tuesdays. We couldn't decide on one thing to do, so we're doing everything. Zoo, camping, picnics? No tellin'. Join [here](https://m.facebook.com/groups/141968913057874).
