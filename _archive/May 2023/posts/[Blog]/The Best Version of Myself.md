The best version of myself is when Iâ€™m somewhere other than home (maybe a coffee shop or a park) with my Kindle and a Field Notes notebook. Learning and taking notes. Away from the internet. Away from all the distractions, feeding and processing new thoughts.

The best version of myself is finding a basketball gym on a nightly basis and playing for hours. Getting the cardio in and sharpening my game against competition. This Keeps me active and fit.
