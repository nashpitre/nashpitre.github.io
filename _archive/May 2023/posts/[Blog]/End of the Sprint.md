[30 for 30](1021) is now complete. A full month of creating every day. I would say it was hard, but it wasn’t. It only required discipline and a system.

- Make a few [Ulysses](ulysses-roam) folders
	- Make a main folder
	- Make sub-folders for each category you want to write about
	- Give each folder it’s own customized (and achievable) [word count](dwc)
	- Make a [new page](lgftf) for every idea
	- Slowly [connect](lgftf) and discard ideas
- [Wake up early](rts)
- Work on this [before](rts) **Everything else**

That was my system. And if I didn’t have [so](girl) much [going](wbah) on, I would never let it end. Because it works.

## Going Forward

What happens after October? This was my closure. I knew I had just a few weeks left before everything changed. I’ll be taking November off from everything. Preparing for my [baby girl](girl).

When I do get back to writing, whenever that time does come again, I know that I love the [daily word counts](), so I’ll be sticking to that process. I also look forward to diving deeper into [Roam Research](ulysses-roam) as well.

But for [now](canp), all that’s left is my [Now](now) page.
