# About my friend, Chase Toups, and how God is working in his life

I'm still learning how to have faith, and I'm still learning how to believe in you, and how to have a relationship with you. But what I have learned, and what I'm most thankful for, is the relationship you've had with my friend, Chase Toups. The transformation you've done on him has made me believe in you more than anything else. 

It's humbled me, and it's shown me that no matter how dark it gets, there's always light waiting for us. His new excitement and glow leaves us all wanting the same. It's contagious. Every week at Cross Church, a new friend of his is sitting with us. That's the only proof needed: you're not only changing his life, you're also changing everyone else's around him.
