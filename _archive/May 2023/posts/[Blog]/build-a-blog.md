# Build A Blog

There’s just a few things you’ll need to know about before starting:

- **[Markdown](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)** is how you’ll write. It’s simple rules and characters (syntax) that you’ll use to turn writing into actually blog posts.

- **[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)** is where your blogs will be stored. Create an account at [Dropbox.com](http://dropbox.com) or through the Dropbox app.

- **[Blot](http://blot.im/)** is a blogging platform that turns a Dropbox folder into a website. Because of Blot, any text file or image added to Dropbox automatically becomes a blog post.

- **[Hover](http://hover.com)** is what allows you to have a custom name, like nashp.com.
