# Going Pro

I’ve always had an eye for photography. I love capturing the world around me and freezing life into a still moment. This has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember. It’s probably rooted from my childhood, watching my grandma carry around a big VCR camcorder everywhere she went, filming our every move.

Last week, we made an investment. We purchased a Sony a7iii. Our first professional camera. I’ve prided myself on only using an iPhone camera for so long (I love how this little device in our pocket can create incredible images), but I knew that it was time to take it a step further. After a decade of photography being a hobby, I’m ready for it to be a job. I want this to be a family business, where my wife, daughter, and siblings can help me as I help others.

For now, I’ll humbly keep my head down with this new camera and focus on building out my portfolio, but I’m as ready as I’ll ever be to make you my next client. I’m not new to this, it’s just a new camera. Keep me in mind for the future.
