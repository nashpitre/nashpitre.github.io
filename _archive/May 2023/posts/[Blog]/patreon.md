# Patreon

## Before

Before talking about what’s next, I’d like to mention what came before it. My previous membership model made exactly $525. I rarely talked about it, and I preferred it to be out of sight, out of mind to those who weren’t interested. I was insecure about asking for money, but I knew it was needed. For it to still bring in that much money, quietly, is something I’m incredibly proud of (Also, this isn’t counting the amount of money the donate button, as well as all merchandise and album purchases, have brought in over the years).  I’m thankful for each and every person that has contributed to my creations, and I’ll never take that for granted.

## Now

Today, I’m streamlining that process, and going more public than I ever have before. Removed is the confusion on how to support my projects. Added is a much stronger service, built for what I was already doing on my own. Starting today, all support will go through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?c=91074). A Patron is someone who contributes $1 a month to the things I build.

**One dollar**: It’s my favorite part of this new setup. You’ll hardly notice a dollar missing, but if I keep doing what I’ve been doing for over a decade, one dollar, multiplied by however many people love the things I make, will add up to a full-time job. And that’s my goal: making it easier to support the things I create. Because every word from every project, ultimately adds up to changing the world. Or at the very least, my own little version of it.
