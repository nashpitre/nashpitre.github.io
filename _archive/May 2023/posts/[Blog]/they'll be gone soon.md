# They'll Be Gone Soon

We try to keep in touch. It's a thought in the back of our minds. To call them as soon as we can, or to stop by and just say hello. And then we get busy with work, and errands, and a list of so many others things that we have to finish before anything else. Just trying to keep our head above water. But that person that we love so much, that we haven't talked to in awhile, they might not be here tomorrow. As soon as you can, reach out to them. The clock is ticking.
