# Where is She?

Such a great party this was, everyone’s mingling. Catching up on each others lives. Through all the commotion, something seemed strange. The cute, sweet, innocent voice that I’m so used to hearing has been absent from all conversations. “Where’s Nevaeh!?” I yell out. I scramble to the patio, look down, only to see her floaties on the fence. “Oh No!” Running as fast as I can, even though I was screaming, the world has now become silent. All I hear is her voice in my head, asking “why can’t I breathe?”

There she was, under water. The party's still going on. Joking, laughing, everything a normal party would consist of. Only one thing stood out - a little girl drowning. The way my heart stopped beating, you would’ve thought I traded with her as soon as I spotted her. I quickly reached into the water, connecting with the 5 little fingers that I know so well. She found me. Not understanding what happen, her only reply was, “I love you too.”
