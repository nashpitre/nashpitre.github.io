# A Year of Margin

![](https://i.imgur.com/6cO9a6z.jpg)

A lot has changed this year. It started at the very beginning, in that first month, and not much has changed since. I fasted from technology and separated myself from the daily ping pong lifestyle that we’ve all come to know so well, for 21 days. But even after the fast was over, 10 months later, I continue to follow a similar blueprint.

For months now, I spent so much time internalizing the world around me. Processing and reflecting instead of reacting. The word stoic continues to come to mind. It’s something that I’ve been striving for for years now. To create margin in my life. Where projects, appointments, and tasks stop bleeding into each other. Where there’s space inside of my weeks.

There were so many moments where absolutely nothing was happening. Silence. No plans, projects, or priorities. Just living, breathing, and being completely still. I embraced this time of solitude with thankfulness, knowing how many seasons of my life I had where I could only dream of a schedule like this. There was no longer anxiety or stress. There was only a calm that kept going. As this year begins to wrap up, that calm is still here. And even though the projects and work schedule will start to take up more of my time again, I now understand what being present really feels like. What a beautiful life this is.
