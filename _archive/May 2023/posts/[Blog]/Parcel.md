# Parcel: a delivery tracking app

![](https://i.imgur.com/kibnrpw.jpg)

I’ve been using [Parcel](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parcel-delivery-tracking/id375589283) for my delivery tracking lately. I just moved into my new house, and Parcel has been great for managing all the packages on the way.

My favorite feature is Amazon integration: when I purchase something from Amazon, I don’t have to manually enter the tracking number — that information is automatically sent to Parcel and begins giving me updates and notifications on the package’s location.

If you find yourself always waiting on shipments, this app is for you. It’s made this moving process a lot easier.
