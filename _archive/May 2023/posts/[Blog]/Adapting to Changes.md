# Adapting to Changes

![][image-1]

Life has been much different for me lately. I went from being a nomad with a backpack that traveled and created new things dailyâ€”to a family man, with a husky, a house and more possessions than I've ever owned before. It took some adjusting, but I think I'm finally getting the hang of all this. From minimalism, container homes, and a motorcycle, to being excited about buying entryway tables and a new washing machine. This isn't the future I expected. It's much better.
