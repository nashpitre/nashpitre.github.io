# A few tweets about the Rockets Warriors game

I haven't been writing about the Rockets much lately, simply because I was trying to figure out who they were. They looked horrible for most of the games they've played so far. Until recently. 

Tonight's game, shutting down the Warriors, and firing on all cylinders on the offensive end, should change the narrative and trajectory of where they've been for the last few weeks. Momentum means a lot.

It's still early, but I'm excited to see this team heading in the right direction.

An interesting stat:
