# 3 Years At Cross Church, 20 Months With No Alcohol

![](https://i.imgur.com/tXKZsr4.jpg)

It’s been three years since I started attending [Cross Church](http://crosschurchhouma.com/). It’s also been 20 months since I’ve tasted alcohol, but the Cross Church milestone is much bigger.

It’s weird to think about life before Cross Church: before having such a strong foundation of friends and mentors, before [small groups](http://nashp.com/tagged/small-groups), and before having weekly services with Pastor Brandon pouring into my life. These things are as important as oxygen to me now.

Letting go of alcohol wasn’t something I had to do, but it felt like a good representation of where I’m currently at in my life. I like this version of myself that doesn’t drink, and as a small group leader, I now hold myself to a higher standard. There’s people that come to my groups that might be struggling with alcohol, and I hope to help them.

The best part about my three years at Cross Church, though, is what it’s done to the people around me. By me simply going to church every weekend, my siblings now go to church every weekend. Not because I announced that I was going, and not because I asked them to join me—I just went, and slowly, they went too.

My brother and his whole family attend every weekend now, and my little brother sleeps at my house on Saturday nights, because he wants to go to Cross Kids the next morning. He packs his Lightning McQueen bag with sleeping clothes, church clothes, and a fidget spinner.

If you’re reading this, and we met through Cross Church, thank you. Your presence in my life, and in my family’s life, isn’t taken for granted.
