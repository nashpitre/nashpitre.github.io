# A Love Letter to Dune

Dune is one of the best movies I’ve watched in a long time. Denis Villeneuve’s (Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, Sicario) style of directing, combined with the rich story from the Dune novels, makes this movie feel like it’s way before our time *and* way after it.

The attention to detail is incredible. There’s so many subtle moments that, if you look away you’ll miss it, while at the same time the movie is moving at such a slow pace that it feels like you’re just going through the day with these characters.

The movie only covers the first half the of the book, so there’s much more story to be told in part two. But what we have here is already something special.
