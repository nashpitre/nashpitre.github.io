# Highlighting Sentences

![](https://i.imgur.com/WWV5osJ.jpg)

I judge a book, not by its cover, but by how many sentences I highlight in my Kindle.

I have a Kindle Oasis. The most expensive one. Not because I paid for it, but because the cheaper version broke on me twice, and the third time they told to pick any Kindle I want and they’ll give it to me free. I picked the Oasis, cellular version.

This week I bought a soft yellow case for it so it doesn’t get scratched or damaged.

In the current [book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400202981/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400202981&linkCode=as2&tag=nashpdotcom-20&linkId=c4fbd365811d546f173c39cbb1d27b22) I’m reading, when the first chapter ended, it made me feel something. I didn’t want to start reading the next chapter right away. I closed the Kindle and just reflected for a minute. I think that’s what the power of good writing should do to you. It has an impact on you, even for just a brief moment.
