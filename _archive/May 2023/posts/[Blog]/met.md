It's time for me to start sharing the ways that I'll be helping our community. This is all through federal funds. The moneyâ€™s there. It's time to make an impact.

Need gas? Need food? Those are two main things people come to me for. Someone just needing a little help.

I also provide free education. Start a career that you know you'd be passionate about: Welding, CDL, Phlebotomy, CNA, MA, and many others. The schooling also comes with with an allowance check every other week to help you while you're going through school. You'll ALSO get those same gas, uniform, and grocery vouchers to help you throughout your time training for your future career.

You basically get a full package of free services, with no catch.

I'm just here to help.
