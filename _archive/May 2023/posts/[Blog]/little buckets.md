# Little Buckets

Every month I go through each service that’s connected to nashp.com — monthly memberships, merchandise, album sales, Tip Jar, etc. — and when transferring those little balances into my bank account, and seeing them collectively become a small paycheck, it’s always fascinating.

A bunch of little buckets working together for the bigger picture.

**Thank you.**
