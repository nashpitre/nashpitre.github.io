 2021 was the year I got back into gaming.  I was away from gaming for years, but now I’m enjoying it more than ever. I’m locked in, thanks to two pieces of hardware:

- [Playstation 5](ps5)
- [Backbone controller](https://nashp.com/the-best-way-to-remote-play-ps5-and-xbox-backbone)

## Backbone

The Backbone controller turns my iPhone into a full gaming system, similar to the Nintendo Switch. Rocket League and Stardew Valley, along with playing game consoles remotely, gives me the power of gaming anywhere I go.

## Playstation 5

The Playstation 5 gives me the best in gaming. Amazing stories of Ellie, Aloy, and Jin are reasons alone to own this console.

The Last of Us series, the Horizon series, and The Ghost of Tsushima. These are the kind of stories that even the best movies struggle to immerse you with. Stories like these are the reason I wanted to get back into gaming.

From the outside looking in, I saw where gaming was headed. I had to jump back in.

## Game Pass

I’m currently playing Forza Horizon 5 on my iPad and iPhone, with either my PS5 controller or the Backbone. The game isn’t actually on my phone though. It’s streaming From an Xbox. And I don’t own an Xbox. What an incredible thought. It’s because of Game Pass, a streaming service, like Netflix, but for video games. Microsoft is years ahead of the competition with this service.

## The Future

I like where gaming is going. With Horizon: Forbidden West in February, God of War in the fall, and Starfield at the end of the year (as well as Zelda!?), 2022 will be year of unforgettable memories in gaming. I’m excited to be back.
