# The easiest way to organize your stuff is to get rid of most of it

I've cut my possessions down to about 70% from last year. Studying minimalism has been one of the greatest decisions I've ever made. It's helped with my peace and anxietyâ€”It was one of many steps I've taken to improve my life.

I can't stress this enough: you don't need as much as you think. When I bought a new pair of shoes a few months back, I got rid of almost all of my other shoes. I only kept one pair of dress shoes, one pair of basketball shoes, and then my new everyday shoes. Since buying my everyday shoes though, it's been the *only* pair of shoes I've put on. The other two are technically not even needed, but I'm a basketball player, and if I get invited somewheres nice, I'll need more than tennis shoes.

I'll be talking about this a lot more going forward, but this tweet inspired me to share some thoughts on the matter.
