# Cleaning Up The Header

I spent some time this week cleaning up my site, specifically the header. First, there's no more picture at the top, which took up half of the header. It's now replaced with the site title written on the side of the links. Second, and for the first time ever on my site, "Music" isn't part of the header linksâ€”not because it's not important anymore, but removing clutter has become *more* important.

My site now has only two main locations: About and Archives.

- **About** page is the home-base for anything other than the main blog.
- **Archives** is to search for something I've written in the past.
