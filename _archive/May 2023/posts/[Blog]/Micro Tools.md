# Micro Tools: Building in the Moment

![](https://i.imgur.com/ixXfXiq.jpg)

When the morning starts, have your tools ready. Whatever your tools look like. These are mine. 

A book on my Kindle, a notebook (Field Notes), my phone, a coffee, and a battery pack (to keep going).

Not a computer. Not an iPad. Nothing getting in the way. Everything here fits in my pockets, but allows me to build incredible new projects.

- The notebook is for handing writing a bullet list log of thoughts. Tracking my day. 

- The phone is either writing words or editing videos. This process is laser focused on executing.

- The Kindle is to keep my mind full of new thoughts and inspiration.

I have bigger and better tools, but for these exact moments, theyâ€™re just distractions. Give me the simple tool to keep the work going.  

All I want to do is continue building, with zero friction. And this is what I find what works best. What does your best setup look like?
