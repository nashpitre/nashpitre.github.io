# Control Your Thoughts

In my headphones, the worship music has been playing all morning. It’s been my soundtrack, as I focus on everything that’s on my to-do list, tackling the dozens of things on today’s agenda. As the music plays, I’m reflecting on the world around me. All the amazing things that have been placed in my life: my job, my family, my friends, my possessions, my church, my perspective. I’m completely filled with gratitude this morning. 

I’ve been having a lot of meetings lately, with even more scheduled this week. Conversations with people that are filling my life with so much insight and wisdom. If you’re one of those people, our talks aren’t taken for granted. They’re helping me become the best version of myself.

It’s fascinating what the mind is capable of. It holds the power to change an entire day, for better or for worse, depending on what you allow inside of it. I’ve been studying this a lot lately. Digging into books that cover this topic.

Our thoughts control everything in our life.

I hope these words reach you in good spirit, and inspire your day to get better, or, to confirm the great day you’re already having. Stay thankful, and if there’s someone you’re thinking of, reach out to them. Don’t just think of them.
