# 2017 Albums (Halfway Point)

1. Kendrick Lamar - DAMN.
2. John Mayer - The Search For Everything
3. Big Sean - I Decided.
4. Logic - Everybody
5. Joey Badass - All-Amerikkkan Bada$$

## Note

I still have work to do though. This list won't be final until the end of June, and there's a few names I still need to listen to before the halfway point is complete, like:

- Jidenna
- Linkin Park
- Lorde
- Ed Sheeran
- Halsey
- Gorillaz
- Tech N9ne
- The Chainsmokers
