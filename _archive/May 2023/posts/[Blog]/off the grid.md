# Off The Grid

The disconnect. It rarely happens. The network is always flowing through us. The stimulation of a connection. Our devices, within arms reach: an extension of our body, like another ligament they offer us, paying monthly to stay attached.

How many minutes or days can we go off the grid? No connection. Have we even tried before? The world makes it seem as if there's urgency here. We can't disconnect. It's impossible. We'll miss out on something. If we don't constantly tell our friends that we're ok, then they'll think we're not okâ€”or even worse, they'll forget about us.

What would happen, though, if we completely went off the grid? Disappear for awhile. Into the wild.
