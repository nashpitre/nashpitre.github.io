# Break Your Year Into Quarters

I’m at my best when I structure my life into quarters. Why map out an entire year when there’s so many variables and things that could happen in that long stretch of time?

Instead, make big targets in an amount of time that allows you to see the finish line. You can make a bigger impact by breaking your year up like this.

So while everyone is planning a New Year’s Resolution, I’m simply focusing on the next three months.

- Q1: Jan, Feb, Mar
- Q2: Apr, May, Jun
- Q3: Jul, Aug, Sep
- Q4: Oct, Nov, Dec
