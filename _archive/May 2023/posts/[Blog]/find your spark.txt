# Find Your Spark

I helped a friend recently. Well, with my community event, I’ve been helping several friends. This whole season has been me leading friends to get them to a new level. Not just with creativity, but motivation to keep pushing forward. Life gets us in ruts, and we forget about what makes us special. It’s so rewarding to see someone find their spark again. If there’s anything I can do to help, please reach out to me. I’ll find a way to help.
