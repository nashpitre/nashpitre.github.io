Austin Kleon is “[a writer who draws](https://austinkleon.com/about/)”, and someone that I’ve been following for many years now. I have all of his [books](https://austinkleon.com/books/), follow him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/austinkleon), and subscribe to his weekly [newsletter](http://austinkleon.com/newsletter). I see a lot of myself in his creative process and the way he makes art. Here’s some pictures of me meeting him while we were in Houston.
