# Create a Kill List

![](https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kobe-Byrant-Obituary.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=960&h=500&dpr=1.5)

*I heard about the [Kill List](https://youtu.be/7CDGM--Hyu8) in this video. Here’s me paraphrasing.*

Kobe Bryant made a “Kill List” of all the basketball players in high school that were ranked above him. There were about 50 of them. 

Circling that game on the calendar, knowing someone on the Kill List was coming up, he’d have a laser focus on getting better in that moment. He’d hunt each one down, and elevate himself in that moment.

One by one, he focused on each player above him until their weren’t anymore. Until he was ranked higher than them.

---- 

We can use this type of (mamba) mentality in our own life. 

What are some targets in front of us that are on the horizon? What are the dozens of obstacles in our way? What are some projects and goals that could be added to our Kill List?
  
Make a list of these things and start executing. Start getting better. It starts with this list. It shows us the path forward.
