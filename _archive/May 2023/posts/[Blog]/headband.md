Introducing [Headband](http://headband.blog/):

- clean, minimal design
- covers all things basketball
- has a variety of writers

I spend a ridiculous amount of time playing, watching, reading, and writing about basketball, so I created a little home on the internet for the sport.

I won’t do it by myself, though. I’m gathering a team ([Get in touch](mailto:nashp@me.com)). The process will look similar to the origin story of any superhero team-up movie. A combination of Tony Starks and Tony Parker.

Everything from NBA to local to college to NBA 2K highlights. Maybe you’ll see plays drawn up on a clipboard, or maybe you’ll see tutorials on how to do a euro-step. There will be personal stories, as well as stories about the legends that paved the way for the wanna-be-legends at the YMCA.

Let’s get started.
