# Planting Seeds

![](https://i.imgur.com/FzvFkev.png)

Yesterday I planted seeds all over the internet. I invited anyone that I could think of to be a part of this [new season of Guest Posts](guest). 

It’s an interesting feeling when you’re laying that kind of ground work. It’s a form of delegating, but it’s also something that you’re now patiently waiting for. Nothing has actually happened yet, but the wheels are in motion. And that’s exciting.

Slowly, everyone’s stories will start rolling in, and I’ll be able to build a schedule for when each one will be released. It’s a fun process seeing everyone get eager to start sharing something important to them.

[Let me know](mailto:%20nashp@me.com) if you want to join in.
