# 75 Year Old’s First Vacation

![](https://d2fbk5uwlkue7.cloudfront.net/uploads/1442201766316_HIRTY7H8VYRP.jpeg)

I’ve spent the last few weeks, helping my friend, Jason Pellegrin, plan and build a [GoFundMe page](http://gofundme.com/gradmas1stvacation). I’ve never done one of these before, but I knew the magnitude they can hold. That’s what took me so long to polish it up and get it *just* right.

I’ve seen them change people’s lives. But I’ve also seen them fade away silently, without hardly any money being donated. I believe it always comes down to clarity. Don’t try to be cute, don’t ask for something you wouldn’t be willing to donate for yourself. All of these thoughts were in my head as we built this. 

My goal was to get in and get out…give your purpose for the page, tell some backstory, ask for help from those that care, and then leave room for the person on the other side of the screen to breathe and decide on helping.

I helped Jason, not only because he’s a great friend of mine who I lean on for many things, and not because his grandmother deserves this vacation, but a thought that stuck out in my head, was my grandmother, who [passed away](http://nashp.com/carol) last year. I kept her mind as I worked on this. I put her in the shoes of Jason’s grandma, and I believe she had my back as I wrote, edited, and polished the words you’re about to read.

To be clear, I only created from a template of what Jason gave me. His heart and plans live in every sentence, I just turned those sentences into something engaging and challenging for you as the reader. The challenge is simple: get his grandma to Colorado. And not just his grandma, but do it for your grandma. If she’s still around, ask her if it’s a good idea for you to help Jason out. If she’s not around, well, I’m pretty sure you know what her answer would be.
