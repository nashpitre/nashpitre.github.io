# Turning Thirty Five

![](https://i.imgur.com/blDmXrC.jpg)

What a beautiful year it’s been to get to 35. A lot of changes. New relationship. New home. New job. New dog. Completely new life. My world looks nothing like it did before last year, and I wouldn’t change that for the world. I haven’t been creating much, because I’ve been creating a family. I’ve been more private than ever, because the world is more noisy now. I’ve fought many battles throughout my life. The silence only means that I finally won.
