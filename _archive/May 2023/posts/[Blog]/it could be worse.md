# It Could Be Worse

I have problems. We all do. And the more I talk to others, and the more I listen to what’s going on in their life, I begin to step out of my own little bubble and see the bigger picture. It’s not just me and my problems. It could be worse. Everyone is fighting their own giant.

This leads me to my next thought: to fix my little bubble, I should be helping others with theirs. (Finding a community to be a part of, a place to serve others, or finding family members that could use a little help.) The main theme is this: in order to fix yourself, stop worrying about yourself. Get out of the way, and be there for someone else.
