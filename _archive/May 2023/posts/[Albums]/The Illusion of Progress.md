# The Illusion of Progress

We’re not ok. We seem fine. But there’s something underneath all of this. All of the smiles and selfies. It appears as if we’re all moving forward in life. It's very easy to look the part. That’s the beauty of living online: the glimpses of who we are, or who we want to be, for a split second, we all look wonderful. But look closer. There’s brokenness. The insecurity. There’s people attempting to reach out for help. But it’s hard. There’s a stigma. There's medicine. And doctors. Just look at us. Look at all the happiness. It’s a beautiful thing. This is The Illusion of Progress.

A simple story about mental health and finding God. The album includes nine songs and thirty different people collaborating with me. When I made this album, it was everything to me: it consumed my time and my identity for months. Now, it’s just a friend from the past that I barely know. It’s an artifact from an old version of myself. All of the deep and heavy topics that’s discussed here, as well anything heavy that you’re currently dealing with, can easily be defeated. It all starts in your mind.
