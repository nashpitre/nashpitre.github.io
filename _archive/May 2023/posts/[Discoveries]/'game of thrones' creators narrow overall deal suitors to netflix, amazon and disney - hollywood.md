> Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss' time at HBO will soon be coming to a close.
> 
> The duo, who created and served as showrunners on the premium cable network's megahit Game of Thrones, are inching closer to a new overall deal elsewhere as they continue to take meetings across town and narrow the field for their new home. Sources say Benioff and Weiss have had meetings for a sizable overall deal with Amazon Studios, Netflix and, more recently, Disney/FX. Representatives for all media companies declined comment, as a deal is far from done.

This is big.
