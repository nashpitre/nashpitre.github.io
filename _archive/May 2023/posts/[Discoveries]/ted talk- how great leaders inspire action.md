# Ted Talk: How great leaders inspire action

[https://youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4](https://youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4)

## The Golden Circle

- Why
- How
- What

---- 

> People don’t buy what you do. They buy why you do it.

---- 

> If you talk about what you believe, you will attract those who believe what you believe.
 
---- 

> There are leaders and those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us. Whether they’re individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead, not because we have to, but because we want to. We follow those who lead, not for them, but for ourselves. And it’s those who start with “why” that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them.
