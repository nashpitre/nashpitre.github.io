# [Simple](http://simple.com)

I waited years for [Simple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-better-banking/id479317486?mt=8) to become reality, and when I finally got the invitation to join, I never looked back: I closed my bank account, and now Simple is all I need for financing.

I received my new shiny white debit card in the mail, and immediately switched my paychecks to be direct deposited into my Simple account. Now with every swipe of the card, my iPhone alerts me with the amount and location of of the transaction.

My favorite feature is Goals, where I can plan and organize all of my expenses throughout the year. For instance, If I need $200 a few months from now, I just set a Goal for whatever day I’ll need it, and Simple will take a small portion out each day, giving me an easy way to save, without affecting my daily expenses. When the day arrives that I set my goal for, that $200 is there. It doesn’t get easier than that.
