## 5am Consulting

I have a 5am consulting session this morning, which is now the earliest I’ve ever been scheduled to help with a project, but it was the only time that fits both of our schedule. This should be interesting.

## Baton Rouge

I had a booth setup at Belle of Baton Rouge Casino for a job fair yesterday. I enjoyed traveling there. The lunch, the public speaker, and all the different people I met to discuss our services.

## Hammond

Making a trip to Hammond today. Looks like it’s gonna be another busy day for me.

## Social

It’s been busy *and* quiet year so far for me. My introverted side controlled most of the year, as it seems I’ve avoided people 99% of the time. This next season will be much different. But it felt right to keep to myself for awhile. It reminded me of a video game: when you’re injured, and then have to take cover, and wait for your energy and health bars to refill.

Now, [music videos](https://www.facebook.com/nashpitre/videos/258127491342216/) are back to being promoted, and [Creative Minds](https://m.facebook.com/groups/288029324892997) is about to kick back off. Excited about what’s coming.

## Basketball

Its been over a month since I’ve played basketball. Similar to being social, I was waiting for my time and energy levels to get to where I need them to be. A month ago, I paused my gym membership because of the lack of time I had to go, and it’s been on my mind ever since. Since then, I’ve had to definitely watch what I eat, because the daily gym calories that I would usually burn would easily add up, and everything I eat turns into weight gain.

For the last two days, though, I’ve played in two adult league basketball games. My stamina was horrible, especially the first game, but I still managed to score about 20 points each game, playing off instincts instead of routines. This was an eye opener for me.

## Sharp Objects

I watched all the episodes so far, but I also read the book (read and listened). The book is complete, and there’s two more episodes left on HBO. Such a powerful story about a broken family.
