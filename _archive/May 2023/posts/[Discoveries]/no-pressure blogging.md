# No-Pressure Blogging

[Manton Reece](http://www.manton.org/2017/03/no-pressure-blogging.html):

> I love that blogs can scale from the trivial to the important. The microblog post about what you had for breakfast. The half-baked rant about something you’re passionate about. And sometimes, the rare essay that really hits the mark and makes people think.

I believe everyone should have a blog. Whether it's for big post, small thoughts, or collecting pictures and videos—a blog helps you think, gives you a voice, and challenges consistency in areas of your life.
