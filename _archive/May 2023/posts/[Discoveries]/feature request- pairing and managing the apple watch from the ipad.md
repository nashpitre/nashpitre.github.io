If I could manage the Watch from the iPad, there would be no need for the phone at all. That might be why they haven’t released it yet — but I don’t think the market for people wanting to do this is big enough yet, so maybe not. I can imagine a world where the iPad is what I use when I sit down, and the Watch is what I use any other time.
