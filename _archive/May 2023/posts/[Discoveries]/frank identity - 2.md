# Frank Ocean - Musical Identity

Here's a must-watch video that was just released, from Evan Puschak, that acts as validation to what I wrote [here](http://nashp.com/blonde), [here](http://nashp.com/2016-albums#blonde), and [here](http://nashp.com/blonde-tracks). It's hard to put an album this good into words, so I'm glad Evan helped explain it. Blonde feels bigger than music.
