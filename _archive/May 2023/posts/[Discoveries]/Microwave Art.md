You're too busy to appreciate the art in front of you. I get it. You don't have time to slow down anymore. So if something is too complicated to pick up on that first watch or listen, it will never get unpacked and absorbed the way it shouldâ€”you're already on to the next thing. There's too many options, with so little time. You would rather your servings come in portions rather than a full meal, that way you can try a variety of flavors. I get it. But there's art out there that's meant to be studied, processed, over a longer timespan. These artist and directors spend years working on their projects, and then you fly through it, without ever getting to know its deeper meanings.
