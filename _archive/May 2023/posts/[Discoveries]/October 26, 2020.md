I'm starting a 5 am routine again. I set my Apple Watch to wake me up every day at that time. Woke up, fixed french press coffee, then began reading Cal Newport’s So Good They Can’t Ignore You. My goal is to have space at the beginning of my day to learn and create. I also want to start running two miles before the sun rises.
