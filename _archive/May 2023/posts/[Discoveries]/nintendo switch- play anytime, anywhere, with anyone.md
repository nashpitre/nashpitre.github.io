# Nintendo Switch: play anytime, anywhere, with anyone

A 5 minute commercial, showing all the different ways the Switch can be used. On the TV, on the bus, at a restaurant, in class, at a party, etc. I'm curious to see how this appeals to non-gamers, because that's who his is being marketed towards too.
