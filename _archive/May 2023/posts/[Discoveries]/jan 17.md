January was a nice start to the year for me. In terms of health, mood, and productivity, everything has been consistent. My schedule was flexible, giving me a lot of time to write, attend [church](http://nashp.com/tagged/cross-church-notes), play [basketball](http://nashp.com/tagged/basketball-sessions), and watch lot of [Netflix](http://nashp.com/netflix-jan-17)â€”all of which kept me at peace.

## Featured

Productivity wise, I wrote a few big posts:

- [10 Reasons Why 2016 Was My Favorite](http://nashp.com/2016)
- [Allbirds Wool Runners: 8 Months Later (Review)](http://nashp.com/allbirds)
- [My Two-Year Anniversary at Cross Church](http://nashp.com/cc2)
- [Rest In Peace, Randal](http://nashp.com/randal)
- [Guest Posts](http://nashp.com/guests)

My [2016](http://nashp.com/2016) writeup is one of the biggest posts I've ever worked on, and as the first post of the year, it sets the bar high for me. I reviewed my favorite shoes, the [Allbirds](http://nashp.com/allbirds), which I wore every day for eight months. January 28th made [two years](http://nashp.com/cc2) that I've been going to Cross Church, so I wrote about how much those two years have meant to me. My friend Randal [passed away](http://nashp.com/randal) last week, and I wrote about how he impacted my life. I'm prepping for my second season of Guest Posts, so I [wrote about last season](http://nashp.com/guests) and invited everyone to join me with Season Two.

## Money

I started selling two new shirts on my site, from [The Impact Collection](http://nashp.com/the-impact-collection). **Randal Strong** and **Hero** are the first two from this collection, and the other two will be released in February.

Donations to the site were steady, and each donation was used to buy [\#RandalStrong](http://nashp.com/the-impact-collection#randal-strong) shirts to give away, helping Randal's family with upcoming expenses.

## Photos

I spent some time testing out the iPhone 7 Plus's camera, and [Portrait Mode](http://nashp.com/portrait-mode) is becoming something I constantly use.

## Around The Web

John Mayer released [Wave One](http://nashp.com/john-mayer-the-search-for-everything-wave-one) of his new album, The Search For Everything. A new wave will come out each month until the album is completely out.

Evan Puschak released two new videos: [The Prestige: Hiding In Plain Sight](http://nashp.com/the-prestige-hiding-in-plain-sight) and [Frank Ocean: Musical Identity](http://nashp.com/frank-ocean-musical-identity), both are important watches to me.

Maxamillion711 released a new Russell Westbrook video, called [No Mercy](http://nashp.com/russell-westbrook-no-mercy). It seems like his videos keep getting better.

MKBHD released an iPhone 7 review, titled [4 Months Later](http://nashp.com/iphone-7-review-4-months-later). He explained why this phone is so good, and what sets it apart from other phones.
