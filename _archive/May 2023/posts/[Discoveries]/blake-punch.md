# Blake Griffin is punching people, he broke his hand...I feel a change is coming

Marc Stein [tweeted](https://mobile.twitter.com/ESPNSteinLine/status/691888176181448707) this morning, that Blake would be out a few weeks from breaking his hand in an undisclosed team-related incident. In other words, fighting.

Business Insider reports that he [broke his hand hitting an equipment staff member multiple times](http://www.businessinsider.com/report-blake-griffin-broke-hand-hitting-equipment-staff-2016-1). This happened after the Toronto game.

Clippers organization:

> This conduct has no place in our organization.

A trade is coming. I feel it. (This is taking into account how well the Clippers have played without Griffin for the past month.)
