# Ten Years of iPhone

[Marco Arment](https://marco.org/2017/01/09/ten-years-of-iphone):

> I’ve seen a lot of major product launches and technology changes in my life and career so far, but nothing else I’ve seen has ever come close to the surprise, magic, and magnitude of the first iPhone, and I don’t expect it to be surpassed in my lifetime.

[Jason Kottke](http://kottke.org/17/01/the-10th-anniversary-of-the-iphone):

> It’s difficult to overstate the impact of the iPhone on the world. In just 10 short years, smartphones have completely and irreversibly changed how a large part of humanity communicates and is quickly changing how the rest will. And that all started with the iPhone.
