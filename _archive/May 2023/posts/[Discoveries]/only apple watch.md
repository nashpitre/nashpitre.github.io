# Cellular Apple Watch

I just ordered the new cellular Apple Watch. For my lifestyle, this is a game changer. For over two years now, my Apple Watch has been the first thing I grab and put on as soon as I wake up. 

- **For health**: tracking movement and monitoring heart rate.

- **For communication**: messages and calls.

- **For time management**: calendar and todo lists.

A combination of being connected while still being focused on the environment around me, changes the way I think about technology. I want all of this information constantly, but I want it to compliment my day, not interrupt it. That’s what the Apple Watch does. I always keep it silent, so it taps me on the wrist with information, and I respond to that tap whenever I’m ready.

With a cellular Apple Watch, I could go to the gym, or go for a walk around the city, or run errands around town, without the need to bring my phone with me. Just the Watch and my [AirPods](http://nashp.com/airpods).

- Phone calls and Apple Music will go directly to my ear, without me ever having to reach for a phone.

- Siri will always be a command away (and because of the W3 chip inside of this new Watch, Siri actually speaks out loud again).

- Maps and directions would all happen from my wrist.

More than anything, though, the chains of technology are now broken off. I don’t have to hold a gadget to get an incredible amount of information, it’s now always a glance away.
