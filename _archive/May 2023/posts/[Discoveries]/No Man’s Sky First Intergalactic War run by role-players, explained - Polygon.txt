> While much of No Man’s Sky space is a peaceful place to explore, one galaxy has declared an intergalactic war. Now, role-players are choosing sides and preparing to contest the 150 star systems in this galaxy in a giant showdown that may last months.



A war is coming. I love this game so much. Hoping combat gets better. But just space traveling alone is worth experiencing.
