[Tim Carmody](https://kottke.org/17/12/black-thoughts-ten-minute-freestyle):

> What I love about Black Thought’s freestyle is that it does everything hip-hop at its best does. He has the technical virtuosity and improvisation, both of which are first-rate. He toasts, boasts, and roasts. He plays with words, and the words play right back.

Black Thought did it again. This is what he always does, but this time, he woke up the internet.
