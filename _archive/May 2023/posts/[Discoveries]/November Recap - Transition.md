# November Recap: A Month of Transition

[Derek Sivers](https://nashp.com/life-can-be-improved-by-adding-or-by-subtracting-the-world-pushes-you-to-add-because-that-benefits):

> Life can be improved by adding, or by subtracting. The world pushes you to add, because that benefits them. But the secret is to focus on subtracting.

## Cartoon Faces

There’s cartoon faces all around me now. I think I’ve created a monster. At the bottom of every blog post, you’ll see the flashing lights of my face. It’s randomly cycling through all the different versions I’ve made. And I can’t stop making them. If you'd like to make your own version to add to that cycle, [download](https://i.imgur.com/VvVHUEV.jpg) the color sheet, add your skills to it, then send it back. I made a [big page](https://nashp.com/cartoon) that features tons of different products to purchase. I also made a [Christmas mug](https://nashp.com/christmas-mug).

## Share Your Gifts

This Apple [commercial](https://nashp.com/share-your-gifts) is heartfelt and worth your time.

## Moving

I spent the month in transition, [moving](https://nashp.com/for-my-brother-001-farewell-to-thibodaux-apartment) from Thibodaux back to Houma. During that time, I became a master of bartering. I downsized all my possessions to the bare minimum, a very fun experiment.

## Rocky

All five [Rocky](https://nashp.com/rocky) films are now free to watch on YouTube.

## 100 Jacket Mission

The [100 Jacket Mission](https://nashp.com/jackets) kicked of again for another year. This year is dedicated to a friend that passed away, Sarah Pell. The focus will be on kid’s jackets. There’s so many kids that need a jacket in our area. It’s sad. I’m hoping the message spreads far enough to make a huge impact on those in need.

## The Lion King

[The Lion King Teaser Trailer](https://nashp.com/the-lion-king-official-teaser-trailer) was released. I keep watching it over and over.

## iPad Pro and GoPro

I bought the new iPad Pro. I also bought a GoPro. I’ve been getting some serious work done with the two. That GoPro and that iPad has been producing a bunch of videos: For My Brother [001](https://nashp.com/for-my-brother-001-farewell-to-thibodaux-apartment) and [002](https://nashp.com/for-my-brother-002-sundays-at-cross-church), as well as [Walk In The Light](https://nashp.com/walk-in-the-light).

## Thanksgiving

[Thanksgiving](https://nashp.com/thanksgiving-2018) was beautiful. It’s always special when I get to spend time with all of my siblings. Wish we could do it more.

## Creative Minds

[Creative Minds: November](https://nashp.com/creative-minds-november) just wrapped up.

## Relationship

I met someone. She’s pretty cool.
