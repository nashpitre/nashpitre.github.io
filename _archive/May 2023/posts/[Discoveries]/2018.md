# 2018

I consider 2018 my year of transition. Many changes and a lot of traveling. Life simply slowed down and became easier for me. There were many things that I spent years working towards, that I finally accomplished. Many battles that I fought from years prior that just aren't there anymore. It's looking like we won.

## Hiking and Camping

![](https://i.imgur.com/CShRMoi.jpg)

I went on a couple [hiking](/clear-springs) and [camping](https://nashp.com/tishomingo) trips this year. Hoping for many more next year.

## New Job

I started a new job, where I help seasonal and migrant farm workers. An office job, with great benefits, great schedule, and an opportunity to make an impact in my community. 

---- 

## Traveling

Along with my new job, came a handful of conferences:

- [New Orleans](https://nashp.com/labor18)
- [Indianapolis](https://nashp.com/indy)
- [Galveston](https://nashp.com/galveston)
- [Washington, DC](https://nashp.com/dc)

The traveling part of the job, locally and out of town, was one of the big reasons I accepted the job offer. It's been nice seeing so many new places.

## Basketball

Played a lot of basketball this year, keeping my health and weight where I feel comfortable. Still looking to get even better at exercising, weight training, and basketball. I still see room to grow here.

## Thirty Two

Turned 32, and [wrote](/32) about it. Midway into the year, I was able to reflect on certain areas of my life.

---- 

## Videos

I created many videos this year, and I see them becoming even more important for me going forward.

## For My Brother

Along with creating videos, I made a little series for my brother, Brayden, to have fun with too. He uses the GoPro for the day, then I edit it after.

## Creative Minds

Started leading a small group again with Creative Minds. I wrote about the importance of [community](/community). I've had an event for September, October, November, and December this year. The plan is to keep going every month now. Every last Friday of every month.

## Invisible Man

I made a little album at the end of the year. 6 songs.

> Invisible Man is about avoiding the noise. It’s about finding a way to make an impact without being in the public eye. Using talents to maneuver through the background of a damaged society. I look around and see the same things from everyone: the way we interact online, the way we deal with controversial topics, the way our attention span prevents us from thinking deeper. Everything is on the surface. This is me taking a step back and finding a different route.

## Cross Church

![](https://i.imgur.com/DzOL2Bl.jpg)

Another year of Cross Church. More on that next month, as it'll mark my fourth year going there. (Here’s where I wrote about year [two](/cc2) and [three](/cc3).)

---- 

## New Home

![](https://i.imgur.com/UdVgC25.jpg)

I moved from Thibodaux back to Houma, and downsized from an apartment to a room. It currently fits my lifestyle way more now. I’ll write more on this next month.

## Girlfriend

![](https://i.imgur.com/MpgdTwg.jpg)

I found someone, and she found me at the same time. A girl from church. We started dating, and we fit into each other's busy lives with hardly any effort. I'm used to relationships feeling like a job. This one feels like a vacation.

## Next

> May your coming year be filled with magic and dreams and good madness. I hope you read some fine books and kiss someone who thinks you're wonderful, and don't forget to make some art -- write or draw or build or sing or live as only you can. And I hope, somewhere in the next year, you surprise yourself. —Neil Gaiman

I hope you had a year of growth. I hope you found peace. I hope you became thankful for things you overlooked. I hope you're exactly where you want to be. And if not, here's 2019. A chance to try again. 

My advice, look at every aspect of your life with laser focus. Every possession, every person, every good thing, every bad thing. Write it all down in list form if you have to. Find clarity in everything that makes you, you. Then reflect on who you want to be, or where you want to be in your life a year from now. Don't just go through the motions of another year. It takes a daily effort, or to put it better, that list you made is your map, so follow that map and that list, and let it lead you to the best version of yourself.

Happy New Year.
