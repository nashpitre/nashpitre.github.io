I’ve been looking for something like this for a long time. A minimal way to track sports scores and stats. I’ve even considered building it myself.  Enter [Plain Text Sports](https://plaintextsports.com/): “a site that shows live NBA games, boxscores and play-by-play in plain text and loads instantly. No frills, and no waiting, just plain text sports”.
