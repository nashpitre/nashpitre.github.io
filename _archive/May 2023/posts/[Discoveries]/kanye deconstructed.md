# Kanye Deconstructed: the human voice as the ultimate instrument

I wish he wouldn't be so outspoken outside of music. It takes away from his brilliance. If you only knew him from his albums, you'd see him differently. You'd see him how I see him. It's unfortunate that his personality diminishes the things that makes him special.
