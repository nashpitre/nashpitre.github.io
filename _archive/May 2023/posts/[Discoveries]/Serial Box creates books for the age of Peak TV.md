# [Serial Box creates books for the age of Peak TV](https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/6/16849756/serial-box-serialized-books-peak-tv)

> Serial Box’s serials are built roughly on the TV show model. Like most TV shows, each title has a writers’ room, with one or two showrunners leading the charge. The showrunners develop a bible that contains all of the necessary information and backstory for the world and the characters, and the writers’ room works together to break down each “season” into episodic chunks that are helmed by individual writers.



Fascinating.
