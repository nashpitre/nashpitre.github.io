This isn't a rap album. It's labeled as R&B/Soul, I would label it as funk. It's a brilliant album that I'll be listening to for years to come. There's not many rappers that have the capability of transitioning to a different genre this effortlessly, but since it's Donald Glover, I'm not surprised. This guys seems to have no ceiling when it comes to creativity (See: [Atlanta TV series](https://www.google.com/amp/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/503870/?client=safari)).
