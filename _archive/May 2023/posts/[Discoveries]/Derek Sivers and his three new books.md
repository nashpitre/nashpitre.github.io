# Derek Sivers and his three new books

[Sivers](https://sivers.org/) is someone who’s work I reallly admire. His lifestyle as well. He creates, or he doesn’t. He doesn’t do social media. He doesn’t get front and center and try to sell you things. He just lives. And creates. His first book came out in 2015 (which you should definitely check out), and he’s been mostly quiet since. Now he has three books in their final phase that are about to release. That’s such a beautiful thing. We’ve exchanged a few emails over the years, and he responds as if he’s an old friend. I appreciate that so much, and because of that, I don’t bother him too much. Only when I have a good question or thought. Similar to what I wrote recently about [Austin Kleon](kleon), Sivers is someone that I relate to in many ways. He’s a trailblazer for me, so I’m always looking for ways to follow his lead.

## Here’s his first book

- [Anything You Want](https://sivers.org/a)

## Here’s his upcoming books

- Your Music and People
- Hell Yeah or No
- How to Live

> **[Your Music and People](https://sivers.org/m)**: a philosophy for musicians (and normal people) of getting your work to the world by being creative, considerate, resourceful, and connected
> 
> **[Hell Yeah or No](https://sivers.org/n)**: For the next ten years, I wrote for hours a day in my private journal, asking myself questions and answering them. Then often taking experimental and radical actions based on these thoughts. The thoughts and experiences that seemed useful to others, I’d share on my website, which are now collected here in this book for you.
> 
> **[How to Live](https://sivers.org/h)**: There's an amazing book called “[Sum](https://sivers.org/book/Sum)”, that has forty radically different, conflicting, and creative answers to the question “What happens when you die?” Directly inspired by that, I've written a book that has twenty radically different, conflicting, and useful answers to the question of how to live.
