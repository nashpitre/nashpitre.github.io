# [An ode to back to school shopping](https://theoutline.com/post/5688/back-to-school-shopping-rules?zd=1&zi=nqmlaoiu)

> When I was younger, one of my favorite parts of summer was the end, when it was time for back to school shopping. It’s not that I didn’t enjoy the school break, but I was a through and through nerd whose love of learning trumped my social anxieties. Back to school shopping meant the possibility of returning to the classroom a more sophisticated, self-assured, and above all, well-prepared kid than when my classmates had last seen me.


I don't think I've ever gotten over the feeling of back-to-school shopping. Getting the right bag, pens, and notebooks are still part of my life on a consistent basis. Maybe even more so now.
