# The Case Against Adnan Syded - HBO Documentary

[https://youtu.be/VA1qzo2WEew](https://youtu.be/VA1qzo2WEew)

> Serial's Adnan Syed is again the subject of a documentary, this one set to air on HBO. Directed by Amy Berg, the four-part series will once more reopen the case of Hae Min Lee to investigate further into the death of the Baltimore student and her convicted ex-boyfriend.

I loved the Serial podcast about this case. I was glued to every episode. This documentary will add another element to that case for me.
