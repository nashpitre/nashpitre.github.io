# [LeBron James to Produce Docu-Series ‘Shut Up and Dribble’ for Showtime](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/lebron-james-shut-up-and-dribble-showtime-1202896065/)

> The series is titled “Shut Up and Dribble,” taken from conservative pundit Laura Ingraham’s remarks to James in February when players from the Golden State Warriors declined an invitation to the White House after the 2018 NBA Finals. The controversy serves as a prologue to the series as it chronicles the modern history of the NBA and its players, starting with the 1976 merger of the freewheeling ABA and the more conventional NBA of today.

Brilliant move from LeBron James and Showtime.
