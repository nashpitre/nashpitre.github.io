# Dear Cowboy Fans

Don’t let those trophies from the past blind you from today’s truth. The Cowboys haven’t been a legit contender since I was a kid with a starter jacket.

The Saints only have one ring, but it’s recent ring. Any fan of the NFL has to respect that. A trophy isn’t easy to obtain, but we have one.

I respect Cowboy fans for the simple fact of always stepping up to any argument, even if it’s with excuses and history as their shield.

But I also feel sorry for Cowboy fans. That organization has some of the most passionate fans in the world, but yet can’t seem to build a winning and consistent team to back up their fans.
