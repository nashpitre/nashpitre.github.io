The weatherâ€™s changing. It's getting colder. I always enjoy this time of year. Brainstorming on a 6-week exercise goal, instead of just trying to get healthier with no end goal in sight. Just finished watching some PlayStation 5 unboxing videos. Look forward to having one of those under my tv.

Currently listening to the podcast Deep Questions with Cal Newport. Started on episode 1. There's a total of 39 episodes to get though.
