I've been reading more. Chipping away at several books on the Kindle. A combination of self-development, business, and fiction. I know the routine and how to build up momentum with words again. It's been awhile since I've been creative, but I haven't been feeding my mind with the usual information that sparks the creativity. Reading does that. I'll continue reading until I begin writing.
