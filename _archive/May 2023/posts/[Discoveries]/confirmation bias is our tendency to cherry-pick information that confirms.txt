# [Confirmation Bias And the Power of Disconfirming Evidence](https://fs.blog/2017/05/confirmation-bias/)

> Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry-pick information that confirms our existing beliefs or ideas. Confirmation bias explains why two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence and come away feeling validated by it. This cognitive bias is most pronounced in the case of ingrained, ideological, or emotionally charged views.

As a writer, confirmation bias is something that scares me. I try to always look at both sides before assuming or making an opinion.

I also practice consuming media that I would usually not enjoy, to have a broader perspective. I believe that seeing things from all angles helps form a better understanding of news, media, and life in general.
