In a time where albums are less relevant than they've ever been, I could appreciate the fact that Jay Electronica hasn't released his debut album yet—even though it's complete. What's the rush? Once it's out, it's out, so why not let the mystery of his first album linger on. The hype of an artist continues to grow tremendously, while the music is nonexistent. Something like this—from what I can remember—hasn't been done before in Hip-Hop[^1].
