> Grab a porg, put on your matching necklaces, and get out your ancient Jedi texts—it’s time to discuss “The Last Jedi,” episode VIII of the “Star Wars” saga. (And if we missed something, please understand that we’ve only seen it once so far!)

Over two hours of discussing the new Star Wars, by some of my favorite podcasters. Perfect complement to listen to after watching the movie.
