John Gruber:

> We, as a species, are hooked up to focus on the short run, and we’re hooked up to seek popularity and avoid criticism. Choosing to do what you *know* will be unpopular in the short run but you *believe* will prove correct in the long run takes courage. Courage of one’s convictions, not courage *running into a burning building to save a life*, but courage nonetheless.
