The Houston Rockets now have the best record in the league, and are on a 10-game winning streak. They’ve proven to be a tough matchup for the Warriors, beating them two out of the three times they’ve faced each other. But the regular season doesn’t matter.

> Kerr has been forced to call out his team. Draymond Green can't make it through 48 minutes without calling out the poor refs. Golden State ranks 28th out of 30 teams in turnovers per game (15.5) and slid into the break 4-4 in its last eight games, falling to Portland 123-117 on Wednesday.

We’re halfway finished with this season, and despite the flaws the Warriors are showing, everyone is still crowning them the champions. Rightfully so, but I [predicted](http://nashp.com/the-return-of-the-nba-and-rockets-and-chris-paul-and-all-the-other-bums-2017-edition) their demise before the season started, and I’m sticking with that prediction. Not only do I see a team that’s beatable, but I’m also seeing a team in the Rockets that—despite having the best record in the league, and despite having an almost flawless record when Paul and Harden play together—is still being overlooked.

Everyone’s reply is, “We’ll see come playoff time.” And I agree, we will see. I like our chances.
