> Exactly 40 years after the original film, Michael Myers returns to finally finish the job. The reboot will serve as a direct sequel to the 1978 release, picking up four decades after the Halloween night massacre. Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle will reprise their iconic roles while John Carpenter returns to his franchise as executive producer. The final face-off is set to take place October 19, 2018.

Forget all the sequels. This takes place directly after the original movie.
