# How Phones Are Designed To Be Addicting

[https://youtu.be/NUMa0QkPzns](https://youtu.be/NUMa0QkPzns)

The addiction is real, and I think our society should be finding ways to help each other fix this issue. 

I’m very intentional about the amount of time I spend on my phone, and I’m always looking for moments in my day to leave it off. I’m careful about mindlessly jumping from one app to the next, and instead, open the phone for specific purposes:

- Writing: this is usually what takes up most of my time on my phone.

- Pictures: a good example is the pictures during my [camping trip](https://nashp.com/tishomingo). Even though I never opened the phone to use an app, the camera allowed me to capture incredible memories.

- Podcasts: playing podcasts all day long, so even though I’m not looking at the phone, it’s constantly playing audio.

- Books: I often read a lot of books on the go.

With that being said, it’s all still excuses. There’s no reason why I can’t step away from the screen more.
