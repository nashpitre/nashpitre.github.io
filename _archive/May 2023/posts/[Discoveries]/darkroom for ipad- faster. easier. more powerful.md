> ## No Half Measures: Building the Best Photo Editing App for iPad
> 
> To build the best photo editor that feels native on the iPad, we need to deliver on three core promises:
> 
> - **Respect the platform:** An iPad app should not be an upscaled iPhone app nor a downscaled desktop app. The best iPad app is touch-optimized, has easy-to-reach controls, and provides efficient access to its most important actions. Similarly, it must fit harmoniously in the iPad ecosystem. Darkroom shines by supporting Portrait Photos, RAW photos, Siri Shortcuts, and adding support for split screen multitasking and keyboard shortcuts.
> 			 
> - **Streamline the editing experience:** Importing photos takes time and effort and creates a duplicate library on your iPad. Worse, you may have to pay twice for storage! The best app should eliminate the import process and deeply integrate with [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/icloud/) Photo Library. Our Library Sync feature means that from launch, all your photos are instantly available. iCloud support is deeply integrated at all levels of the app, and you can favorite, hide, delete, and export without creating a shadow library.
> 			 
> - **Be familiar:** What good is a powerful feature if nobody can use it or find it? Pro-grade tools have often lagged behind consumer tools in design and usability, but we believe that’s a false tradeoff. We pride ourselves on the usability and focus of our pro-grade tools. The best app should be familiar, recognizable and friendly. We have made pro-grade photo editing as fast and easy as browsing photos.

Darkroom has been my photo editing app of choice for several years now. And now it’s finally on the iPad. Download it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-editor/id953286746).
