# 2016 Goals

I have many things I'd like to accomplish in 2016. Here's a list of them:

**Big Goals: these are goals that are non-negotiable, no excuse to me.**

* Stay focused and consistent with my health (sleeping patterns, morning routines, dieting, building muscle)
* Read the entire bible (my pastor said the church does it together each year, so I'll be joining them)
* Get 6 months ahead on major bills (car note and rent)

**Small Goals: many of these are on my list to do, and I have every intention to finish them, but they're not as critical to me as the above three.**

* Finish the first draft of my book
* Start college
* Go on my first cruise
* Read 50 books
