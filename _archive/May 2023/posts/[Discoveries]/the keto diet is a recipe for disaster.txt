# [The keto diet is a recipe for disaster](https://theoutline.com/post/6133/the-keto-diet-is-a-recipe-for-disaster)

> Losing weight has become a challenge to be solved through innovation, and the new diet gurus don’t take kindly to the scientific method. It’s in line with Dr. Atkins’s legacy; he was a huge proponent of alternative and unproven medical treatments beyond just his ideas about nutrition. You almost can’t blame him or the other diet gurus for leaning in on the techno-bullshit market; it’s hard to fill up a 300 page diet book on “eat a bit less and find a type of exercise that doesn’t make you hate life.”

I have thoughts on Keto, and every other trendy diet that shows up each year. But I'll save that for another day. This quote gives enough for now.
