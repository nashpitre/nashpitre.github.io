# October Recap

![](https://nashp.com/_image_cache/69154fb9-c82e-456f-88a3-14c7a29ec690.jpg)

October was a month of finding balance. Of being grounded. A lot of resting (everyone around me told me I didn’t have a choice). I spent a lot of time doing things that were out of my usual routine. Like serving at a women’s conference. Like riding a motorcycle in the rain like I’m Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible. Like being at the gym for 4 am workout sessions. Like preparing to be a basketball coach in the coming weeks. If your life is off, even by a little bit, challenge yourself to get out of that season as soon as possible, simply by trying new things. Switch things up. It’s your life, you can do anything you want. Here’s to November.

# Music Videos

I created two music videos this month. One was a brand new song, that was so therapeutic that I think nearly fixed every single thing I was dealing with in my heart. The other was just another layer to a finished album.

Church was so powerful for me this month. I’m thankful to have these services to attend each week.

# 100 Words

Started a new project two weeks ago, where I try to write at least 100 words a day, and share. Some days were more successful than others. Here’s a link to all of them so far. It’s a project that I’m really proud of. Very challenging.
