Pat Dryburgh:

> It’s never been easier to publish writing online. Hell, it’s never been easier to publish just about anything online. It’s not a technical challenge I face. It’s a psychological one.

> Truth is, those same feelings apply to a number of areas in my life. I do not feel that I’m living up to my potential, nor do I feel a true sense of what the limit to that potential is. It’s not a matter of talent or inspiration or even time. It’s a matter of discipline. And discipline is born of routine.
