> A college student faces an impossible journey when he is left stranded in the desert, thousands of miles from home, with no money and only a few days left until Christmas.

A simple Christmas movie to watch that I enjoyed. Cheesy, bad acting, but comforting. Put it on to have it in the background, but stuck around to see what happened next.
