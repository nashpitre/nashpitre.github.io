# Breath of the Wild

[Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/breath-of-the-wild/):

> The game is about the large forces of destiny and time, but at a human scale, where we’re dwarfed by responsibilities that initially feel unshoulderable. It’s about vulnerability and unpreparedness, and learning that the universe doesn’t care whether we survive. It’s about that sense of being thrown into a world that, by and large, isn’t waiting for your arrival; it’s already in progress, dangerous, and not built in your favour. And ultimately, it’s about mastery of your environment, and of course your fate, against the odds.
