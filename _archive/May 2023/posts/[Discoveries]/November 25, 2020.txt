## Today's thoughts:

- Playing
	- [Amazon Luna](https://www.amazon.com/luna/landing-page)
		- Fascinated by this game streaming service. I’m seeing no lag, and it’s as if the game is downloaded somewheres. But it’s on my FireTV (and iPad), just streaming.
		- Games so far
			- Shadow Tactics
			- Control
			- Metro Exodus
- Watching
	- Turner Classic movies
		- East of East of Eden
		- Citizen Kane
- Thanksgiving
	- Family home from Texas
	- Visiting my family and Olivia’s
- Writing
	- Wrote a premise for a Christmas story right when I woke up.
	- Plans to send old writing onto the blog
	- Plans to create new “[Workshop](tagged/workshop)” posts. I was doing it daily back then, but maybe it’s a weekly thing?
- Reading
	- Finished the sample of Ready Player Two. Can’t wait to finish the rest of the story.
	- 21% into Chuck Palahniuk’s Consider This. A book about writing.
- Basketball
	- Been playing a lot more lately. This week most people won’t be playing though. Thanks to Thanksgiving.
- Selling things
	- Sold:
		- Apple TV
		- Keychron K6
		- Raspberry Pi
		- Variety of other small things
	- Slowly getting rid of random things that are nice but I never use. Getting back down to just the essentials.
