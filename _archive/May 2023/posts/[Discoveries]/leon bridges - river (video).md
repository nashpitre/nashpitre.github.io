# Leon Bridges - River (Video)

> Been travelling these wide roads for so long. My heart's been far from you. 10,000 miles gone. I wanna come near and give you every part of me, but there is blood on my hands, and my lips are unclean. In my darkness I remember Momma's word reoccur to me: "Surrender to the good Lord, and heâ€™ll wipe your slate clean." Take me to your river.
