## Clarity

I’m searching for clarity. A lot more than usual. My head has been cluttered lately, with so much on my plate, I need to get back to the basics, and look at all of this from a different perspective. I’ve been walking through this maze in my mind, and I’m currently lost in it. I need to take a step back, and reevaluate a lot of things. An aerial view. I’ll do this soon.

## Division

It’s weird to watch two friends fuss over politics online, but I expect it nowadays. People’s views on how society should be managed *is* completely divided. The word **divided** is used as propaganda now, so even that word has lost its meaning. When I see this, all I see is the word “me”: an argument around politics, at least from my perspective, is a selfish one. A point of view, about how, “it doesn’t matter what someone else wants, as long as I get what I want.” And when I see this, I don’t see a silver-lining. There’s no way out. It doesn’t matter the president, because the president isn’t the problem. We are.

## Summer Project

Yesterday, I made a small group public, called [Summer Project](/summer). I didn’t do a big rollout like usual, and the group is actually in between the small group season, so it won’t have the usual promotion from my church the way they usually do. But I wanted to be intentional about doing something this summer. That’s the goal, not getting a bunch of people to join me. 

## Files

Nobody cares about me talking about files, but it’s constantly something I’m trying to figure out. I’m dealing with so many old recordings, as well as the new ones. And I’m trying to manage them all. Figuring out the best way to organize these have been combination of nightmare, lightbulb, and everything in between. I’m getting closer to solving this, but I’m scared I lost an entire album, a very old album of mine, in the process. I can’t wait to figure all of this out.
