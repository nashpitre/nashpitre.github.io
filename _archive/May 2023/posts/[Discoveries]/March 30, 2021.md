	All of my blessings
	Blessings
	You're in the presence of
	Someone that never settled
	He always looked
	Over the horizon
	Knowing the sun was shining
	On the other side
	Of the problem
	And the only way to fix it
	Is to fix it
	Don't, give up
	Read your scriptures
	Understand the bigger picture
	Wisdom is when you understand
	The power of a whisper
	Being louder only 
	Makes you stand out more
	But it doesn't change the outcome
	You love, you lose, you
	Kept it moving
	It's all changing like a mood ring
	On to new things
	A new season.
