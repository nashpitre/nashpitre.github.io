Reading The Organised Writer. Setting up templates to start a new project. Rethinking the email newsletter. Was going to do a weekly essay every Monday, but I should push that back for now. Spend some time preparing for it first, and get the site flowing again before committing to something too big.

Got my motorcycle fixed today. Chain tightened and air in tires. Rides much smoother now. Look forward to riding it when I return next week. But for now, three hour ride in the passenger seat back to Lake Charles. Watching episode one of The Queenâ€™s Gambit on Netflix during the trip.
