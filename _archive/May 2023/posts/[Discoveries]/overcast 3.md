Marco Arment:

> [Overcast 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8) is now available, and it’s a huge update, mostly in the design and flow of the interface. I’ve been working on it since last summer, informed by over two years of testing, usage, and customer feedback.

I use [Overcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?mt=8) every day. You should too.
