# [New Musical Express: Travis Scott – 'Astroworld' review](https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/travis-scott-astroworld-review)

> This is the sound of a musician who has worked to forge an entire world, an empire, around himself – we can peer in, but from afar, guessing at his motives and life behind the velvet rope.

Travis Scott has always been underrated. He's an artist that blurs the line of trendy and thoughtful. It's always refreshing to hear his sound, because he's meticulous when it comes to the details. This album is no different.
