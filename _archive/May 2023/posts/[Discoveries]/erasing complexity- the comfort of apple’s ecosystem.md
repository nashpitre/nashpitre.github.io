# Erasing Complexity: The Comfort of Appleâ€™s Ecosystem

[Federico Viticci](https://www.macstories.net/stories/apple-ecosystem-comfort/) on AirPods:

> This is something I've been thinking about a lot since I started working out every day and having a more active lifestyle. I use my AirPods every day, multiple times throughout the day, in contexts when I feel like I want to listen to audio without disturbing other people. Unless I'm extremely focused on writing, complete silence freaks me out. If I'm around other people, or if I don't want to listen to music or a podcast on my HomePod, I put my AirPods on. And they always work. They're never out of battery, they never get out of range when I walk around the house, and they support all the basic controls I need. Combined with my Apple Watch, the AirPods fit so seamlessly in my lifestyle without requiring additional thought, they have become second nature.

> AirPods deliver on all these fronts: the combination of good-enough sound and deep integration with iOS means I'm free to listen to music or podcasts in more places or situations that would otherwise be problematic (or downright unfeasible) for other types of headphones or earbuds. I can summon Siri with a quick double-tap on the left AirPod and transfer phone calls from my iPhone without having to worry about cables, range, or hidden gestures. AirPods give me independence while also being intrinsically tied to the iPhone.
