# 111 NFL players' brains were examined and all but one of them had brain damage (CTE)

[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/sports/football/nfl-cte.html) just released an astonishing article on the NFL and CTE. The more I learn about concussions, the more terrified I am of the sport. Despite it being something we did daily growing up, I couldn’t imagine my little brother playing football now (he’s not interested in it anyway). I’ve been checked out of watching NFL for years now, and stats show that I’m not the only one. My personal belief is that the NFL has already peaked, and it’s all downhill from here.
