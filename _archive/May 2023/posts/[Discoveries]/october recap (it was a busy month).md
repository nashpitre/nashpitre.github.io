# October Recap (It was a busy month)

###### It’s been awhile since I’ve had this much peace and clarity in my life. In all three areas (Personal, Work, and Creativity), October was good a month for me. Let’s see why.

---- 

## Personal Life

The month started with me [scratching my cornea](https://nashp.com/scratched-cornea-productivity-life-hack). It hurt. I received medicine, and a few days off — and with that time off, I was able to breathe and focus on life from a higher vantage point. It’s been paying off ever since. I bought the [new](https://nashp.com/_image_cache/97dfdca7-0524-4484-9456-f5aaee0848ab.jpg) Apple Watch. I [traveled](https://nashp.com/october-19-2018) out of town for a few weeks for work, played a lot of [basketball](https://nashp.com/october-24-2018), and made/saved a lot of money, thanks to Financial Peace University. I started using [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) again to manage all the different areas of my life. (One of those areas included playing a lot of [Red Dead Redemption](https://nashp.com/red-dead-redemption-2-review-roundup) this past weekend.)

## Jay Ray

During my resting time with my eye, I was able to release a guest post by [Jay Ray](https://nashp.com/finding-purpose-by-jay-ray) (he was my sidekick through this month, behind the scenes, making an impact on many layers of my projects and new features on my site). His guest post will help see how he thinks and operates. He also helped with my friend [Janea’s website](https://www.janea.net/) that I built last year, and together, all three of us finally made it public.

## Studio Session

Next up, in that same weekend of me resting my eye, I wrote, recorded, and released a new song, titled [Invisible Man (Are We Dreaming)](https://nashp.com/are-we-dreaming). This was before my microphone, after eight years, [finally died](https://i.imgur.com/daicgTM.jpg). We tried, but couldn’t revive it (it powers on, but doesn’t capture sound anymore).

## Stolen Shirt

I released a [new shirt](https://nashp.com/you-say-backpack-i-say-rocket) from some words I found on Instagram, that matched how I always feel. I stole those words from the profile, got her permission after showing her the shirt design, then requested a paragraph to promote the shirt. Creativity never looks the same.

## NSHP.XYZ

I also [bought](https://nashp.com/october-30-2018) a new domain for when I need to make short urls: [nshp.xyz ](http:nshp.xyz)is now mine for now, to help brand all the links I send out around the internet.

## Apple Watch

The biggest thing I did this month (other than what follows this paragraph) is write a long [Apple Watch](https://nashp.com/apple-watch) post, explaining why this little device on my wrist has replaced the iPhone for me. Even if you don’t care about the Watch, you’ll be shocked by how much it can possibly do.

## Creative Minds

The next biggest thing I did was host the [Creative Minds: October](https://nashp.com/creative-minds-october) event. We had a good crowd. Acoustic guitars, singing, and everyone (adults and kids) doodled on index cards, and there was a giveaway at the end: a random person from the pile of index cards won a [Creative Minds shirt](https://nashp.com/create). I finished the month off by creating the flyer for the [Creative Minds: November]() event — keeping the momentum rolling into the following month already.

#### Hello November
