This is way overdue. A family usually has one iPad they're sharing with the whole family. It only makes sense that when anyone in the family picks up the iPad, they tap on the their face to open up their apps, settings, and background. In iOS 9.3, the first glimpse of this was shown, but only for classrooms. I'm confident that this will be a family feature soon.
