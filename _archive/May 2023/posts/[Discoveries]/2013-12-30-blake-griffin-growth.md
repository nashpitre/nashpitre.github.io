# [Has Blake taken the next step?](http://www.clipsnation.com/2013/12/30/5254690/la-clippers-blake-griffin-taken-the-next-step)

> After scoring 40 points for the first time since his rookie season against Utah on Saturday, it seems as if Blake Griffin is taking the long anticipated next step in his development as a player.

Blake Griffin looks more confident now than I&rsquo;ve ever seen him. When he catches the ball in the mid-range area, he shoots it without hesitating. When he steps up to the free throw line, he&rsquo;s knocking them down, and if he misses the shot, he gets upset, as if he was expecting to make it, unlike before when he&rsquo;d look surprise to see the shot go in. And now, when he catches the ball in the post, he knows what he wants to do: attack, use his speed, and draw a foul. His last few games have been very impressive, I've never seen him look this dominant.
