# As usual, Clippers' Crawford a steady source of reserve power

Crawford started the year off slow, but I blame that on the lack of chemistry the team's reserves had. Once Josh Smith and Lance Stephenson were gone, Jamal played as his usual self. And for the first time in years, Crawford will be going into the playoffs fresh and injury free. I expect him to do big things throughout the playoffs.
