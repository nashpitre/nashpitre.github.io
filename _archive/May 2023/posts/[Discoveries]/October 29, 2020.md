Woke up to it freezing outside. Great feeling (after putting pants and hoody on). Two more days of work in Lake Charles, then it’s back home for Halloween and my little sister’s birthday.

Some morning thoughts:

Don’t read and follow only like-minded people. Don’t think that the people you’re Facebook friends with or who are in your bubble is the truth everywhere else. Confirmation bias is a horrible thing that confuses people into thinking they’re 100% right. There’s a whole world out there that sees much more than you do.

Allow yourself mental space to be curiosity. Ask questions. Remain humble and nimble enough to change your mind. Don’t be set in your ways—ways that are usually not even your own, but the people around you think it, so you should probably think it to.

I look around and see so many blinded by their own opinion, rage, and insults. The insults is what gets me the most. I see a group of people rather joke and make fun of something instead of being curious about it. They’re basically walking into a book store, making fun of every cover, while never reading an actual book.
