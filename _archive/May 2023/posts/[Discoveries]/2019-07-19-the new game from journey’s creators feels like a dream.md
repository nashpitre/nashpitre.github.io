> Out now on iOS and coming eventually to Android, Sky: Children of Light feels like an extension or offshoot of 2012’s transcendent cooperative adventure game, Journey. The player, a titular child of light, is a caped figure who embarks on an adventure across seven fantasy realms, using light to revive fallen stars and reform constellations. Players interact with the world and their fellow players via a series of simple icons and gestures as they work together to solve the game’s puzzles and uncover its mysteries.

I've been waiting for this game for awhile now, ever since it was announced on stage at an Apple event. It even has controller support, which will make it that more appealing for me to play. I look forward to playing this throughout the weekend. Hopefully it lives up to the hype.
