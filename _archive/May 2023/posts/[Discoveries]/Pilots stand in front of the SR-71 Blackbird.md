> Their job is something the human race has a hard time grasping. They travel faster than any other human. Higher than any other human (minus astronauts). They've basically ascended to a form of reality experiencing greater knowledge and truths, than most people on the planet ever will. Not to mention the sights of the curved earth beneath them.
