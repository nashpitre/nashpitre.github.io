#### The reviews for Red Dead were released today, so I spent some time curating my favorite videos, quotes, and pictures.

###### As I’m making this roundup, the game has a 97 score on [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/red-dead-redemption-2).

> Whether I’m hunting a legendary animal, participating in a story mission, playing a game of poker, or just exploring the world I’ve absolutely adored every moment I’ve spent with the game. It more than fulfills every hope and desire I’d garnered as my anticipation for it grew over the last several years. The phenomenal narrative and performances are emotionally impactful, and the depth of interactivity embedded into the pristinely polished gameplay is nothing short of groundbreaking. Rockstar have outdone themselves with Red Dead Redemption 2 as it ushers in a new era of what the medium is capable of achieving. At this point, I can’t wait to start again to explore a different playstyle and especially jump into Red Dead Online.

> There can be no doubt that this is a landmark game. It is a new high water-mark for lifelike video game worlds, certainly, but that world is also home to a narrative portrait of the wild west that is unexpectedly sombre and not afraid to take its time. With very few exceptions, the many stories that Rockstar’s writers have set out to tell about this group of outlaws land perfectly, the enjoyable twists and turns of individual missions and chapters feeding into an exciting, sophisticated and absorbing larger narrative – and the stories that you discover yourself within its world are no less compelling. Around 2,000 people worked very hard (probably too hard, in some cases) to make this game possible. Every last one of them should be proud of their contribution.

[Brandon Jones](https://easyallies.com/#!/review/red-dead-redemption-2): 

> Red Dead Redemption 2 tests the boundaries of interactive immersion. Few games look this good, play this well, and have this much to offer. It begs you to slow down, turn every page of its dramatic tale, and savor every last breathtaking detail. It challenges you to be prepared for anything, and make the right decisions when your choices matter most. Arthur Morgan is the lead, but the world takes center stage to pull you in. With a list of challenges left to finish and an online mode launching soon, we plan to spend a lot more time in Rockstar’s unparalleled recreation of the old west.

[Luke Reilly](https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/25/red-dead-redemption-2-review):

> Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one of this generation’s very best single-player action experiences? Here’s your huckleberry.

[Kallie Plagge](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-outlaw-country/1900-6417019/):

> Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, and it's a world that is hard to leave when it's done.

[David Meikleham](https://www.gamesradar.com/red-dead-redemption-2-review/):

> This is a stone cold 5/5 classic that combines brilliant writing – Rockstar’s Houser brothers deliver another affecting, scythe-sharp script – amazing tech, and one of the most boldly structured plots to ever grace a triple-A title.
