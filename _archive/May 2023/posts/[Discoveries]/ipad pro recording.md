I did some research night before last, on what it would take to make my microphone (Blue Yeti Pro) work on the iPad Pro. I found Jason Snell's article on the [Lightning to USB 3 Adapter](https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/03/apples-lightning-to-usb-3-adapter-brings-ipad-podcasting-one-step-closer/) article, and it showed me exactly what to do. I woke up yesterday morning and went straight to Best Buy, then Target ... none of my local stores carried this adapter. So I made a day out of it, driving an hour away to the closest Apple Store to get this little piece.

It got my little brother out of the house. We ate Cafe Du Monde's Beignets. I bought him a Lego Dimension's Superman toy. 

Later that night, I recorded my first studio session with just the iPad Pro and the Blue Yeti Pro. [Here's the unfinished song](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/n4ki386l49l4aix/33%20-%20Now%20or%20Never.m4a). I'm excited to get this amount of quality on the iPad.
