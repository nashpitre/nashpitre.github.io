# The Ripple Effect: Enough Little Things

[Seth Godin](https://seths.blog/2020/04/enough-little-things/):

> We rarely have complete control over the big issues.
> 
> But the way we interact with each other, the small kindnesses, the extra effort–it adds up.
> 
> One after another, day by day.
> 
> It might be enough to change someone’s day. And then the ripple continues.
