Uncrate: 

> Sometimes Sci-Fi becomes real life. Available in powder or pre-mixed liquid forms, Soylent provides all the nutrition you need, including essentials like proteins, healthy fats, slow-metabolizing carbs for energy, vitamins, and minerals. And while most of us are likely to have a cup/bottle when we're too lazy to make real food, you could actually consume it, water, and nothing else and live a perfectly healthy lifestyle (or so the fine print says).

Saw this on Uncrate, did some research, and then ordered me some. Look forward to trying it.
