# [Apple Is Worth $1 Trillion; 21 Years Ago It Was on the Brink of Bankruptcy](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/technology/apple-stock-1-trillion-market-cap.html)

> Apple’s ascent from the brink of bankruptcy to the world’s most valuable public company has been a business tour de force, marked by rapid innovation, a series of smash-hit products and the creation of a sophisticated, globe-spanning supply chain that keeps costs down while producing enormous volumes of cutting-edge devices.

What an incredible turnaround. This is a story about quality above everything else.

> I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next.
