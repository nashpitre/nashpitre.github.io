# Turn the invisible...

> How can you show your work even when you have nothing to show? The first step is to scoop up the scraps and the residue of your process and shape them into some interesting bit of media that you can share. You have to turn the invisible into something other people can see. â€” [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)
