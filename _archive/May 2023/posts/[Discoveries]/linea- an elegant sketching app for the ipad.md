[ John Voorhees]():

> Linea is a sketching app, not a full artist’s toolbox. It won’t replace a more complex app like Procreate, but that’s not its purpose. Instead, Linea is focused on delivering the best possible sketching experience whether you are drawing, prototyping an app interface, storyboarding, taking notes, or something else. The point is to get visual ideas down with the least amount of fiddling, which is exactly what Linea delivers.

This will be my brainstorming and adding visual illustrations to my site app. Seems like the app for someone who isn't that great at drawing, but still wants to have a visualization of what he's thinking. At $9.99, [Linea](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/linea-sketch-simply/id1094770251?at=11lbfL&ct=ms136&ls=1&mt=8) is the perfect compliment to the Apple Pencil.
