# What reviewers are saying about Kendrick's new album

[Christine Clarke](https://nowtoronto.com/music/album-reviews/kendrick-lamar-damn-review/), writing for NOW Magazine:

> Countless rappers claim to have transcended the game. Kendrick Lamar actually does. There’s the sense his ambitions on DAMN. are even larger, reaching toward something more universal, fateful even spiritual in its reach to find the link tying all contradictions together.

[Neil McCormick](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/kendrick-lamar-star-hip-hop-has-waiting-damn-review/), writing for The Telegraph:

> From DNA’s punchy electro mantra about identity to LOVE’s tender sing-song reggae pop meditation on fickle emotions, DAMN is an album of surface sheen and hidden depths, where words and music operate in beautiful synchronicity, a constantly unfolding dance that lends each new approach a sense of investigation and revelation. It is dazzling.
