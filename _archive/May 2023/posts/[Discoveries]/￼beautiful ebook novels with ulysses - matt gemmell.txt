# [Beautiful ebook novels with Ulysses - Matt Gemmell](https://mattgemmell.com/beautiful-ebook-novels-with-ulysses/)

> Within the next week, the second novel in my KESTREL thrillers series, entitled TOLL, will be released. I wrote it entirely in Ulysses, and Iâ€™d like to share my method for creating beautiful epub ebooks of novels using Ulysses itself.

His new book is out today (highly recommend), which was made entirely on the iPad in Ulysses. That's where all of my writing also lives, so this article is incredibly useful for me. My book, Alchemy, will be using this same formatting that he used, since his is tried and tested (even though his is for a novel and my first attempt will be for a lyric book). I'm excited to start using this process.
