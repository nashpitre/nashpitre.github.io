> Nintendo has released its earnings for the first three months of the current fiscal year alongside updated sales figures for the Switch. The company says itâ€™s sold 19.67 million Switch consoles as of June 30th, meaning the actual figure is likely to have reached 20 million already.

One of the best purchases I've ever made. Mine is all scratched up, showing it's wear and tear, and I'm proud of that. It travels where I travel, and it has some of the best games that have come out in the last few years.
