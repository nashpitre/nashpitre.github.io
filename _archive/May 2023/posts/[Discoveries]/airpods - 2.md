# Introducing AirPods

This was what I was most excited for leading up to and during yesterday's event. I usually have one headphone in at all times, as I listen to podcast. I couldn't have imagined a cleaner and more elegant way to do this the way Apple has.

AirPods have no buttons, no wires, and packs so much technology inside of this tiny little pod. For instance, take one pod out of your ear and the music simply pauses, or double tapping the side of the pod and it awakes Siri, or because of iCloud, it's already paired with your iPad when you want to listen to audio on there, allowing you to jump from one device to another without having to reconnect.
