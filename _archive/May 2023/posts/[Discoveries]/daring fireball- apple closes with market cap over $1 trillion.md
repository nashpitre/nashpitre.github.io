# [Daring Fireball: Apple Closes With Market Cap Over $1 Trillion](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/02/apple-one-trillion)

> Apple closed today with market cap of $1.002 trillion. That “.002” looks insignificant but represents $2 billion — about what the entire company was worth in 1996.



This is crazy.
