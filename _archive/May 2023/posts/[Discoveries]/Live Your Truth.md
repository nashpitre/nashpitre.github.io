I just finished reading this little book in just two days. I couldn't put it down. If you look through the Kindle highlights underneath this post, you'll see a lot of quotes from it. I probably highlighted 70% of the book. It was that good. I can't recommend this book enough. Now, I'll start reading his first book, [Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It](https://www.amazon.com/Love-Yourself-Like-Your-Depends/dp/1478121734). Expect more highlights.
