## Lottery

My office all pitched in two dollars each, for a 500-million-or-whatever lottery tonight. I’m looking at dozens of numbers now, and I’m not getting my hopes up, but just imagining winning feels insane. The thought of this . . . I started brainstorming on what I’d do first. It was a fun exercise.

## NEXT

Today’s the day. No Man’s Sky NEXT has been released. Check out these [Patch Notes](https://www.nomanssky.com/next-update/). My little brother slept over last night, and when I woke up at like 3:40am, he was still up playing Fortnite. I heard the TV still on, and I yelled, “Go to sleep, Brayden!”, and ten minutes later, he was passed out on the sofa. But tonight, starting in a few hours, I won’t have anyone to yell at me to turn No Man’s Sky off. I have tons of coffee in me, and I’m prepared for an all-nighter.

## Nerd Day

Yesterday was nerd day for me. Once Charter tested the WiFi connections, and gave me the login information, my apartment looked like two pilots in a rocket ship, flipping switches and preparing for launch: iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Switch, Xbox, Mac mini...all systems go. Liftoff. We have liftoff.

## Cartoons

Check out these cool illustrations at the bottom of the page. My site has never looked so alive. I can get used to this.
