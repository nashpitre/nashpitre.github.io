> Genius is the worldâ€™s biggest encyclopedia of music, built by artists, scholars, and super-fans working together to go deep inside their favorite songs. Now the encyclopedia has a soundtrack. Starting today, Apple Music subscribers who visit Genius will be able to play any song in full right from the song page, simply by signing into their Apple Music account.

Genius is where I go to dive deep into a song. I usually do this while listening to the song in Apple Music. Now they're connected. This is big for Genius, to see them continue to grow, and to continue to show the importance of the depth and breakdowns of lyrics.
