Getting things squared away on this new version of the site. It’s still not where I want it to be, as I try to rebuild its foundation, but I’ll keep chipping away at it. The projects page will be a simple timeline of all my big projects, and the rest of the site will be a footer that surfaces the wide range of content, right at your fingertips. A goal to be minimal but still with many layers is a tall task, but it’s possible, and we’re almost there. A vision and a partner like Jay Ray to code everything up has helped this site take the shape that I imagined.
