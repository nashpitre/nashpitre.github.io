When someone asks me what’s so special about the iPhone 7 Plus (especially when comparing it to the iPhone 7), I answer with one thing: Portrait Mode. On the 7 Plus, there’s two lenses—one for what you’re aiming at, and one for everything behind it—which allows the camera to blur out whatever's not being focused on.
