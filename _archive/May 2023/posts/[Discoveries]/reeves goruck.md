I have the GR1 21L, and I’m in the process of swapping that one out for the 26L, for a little more space for traveling/gym clothes and shoes[^1]. These two videos caught my attention. If you wonder why I love these bags, these videos will help.

[^1]:	The 21L is *almost* perfect for everything I need, but it’s such a tight fit when I put basketball shoes in it. And during my [Nola trip](https://nashp.com/labor18), I packed for four days, and it was a little bit too tight for me. That’s when I knew that I needed the 26L, to give me a little more space.
