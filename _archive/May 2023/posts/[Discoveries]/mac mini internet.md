# Mac mini + Plex Server: wifi keeps disconnecting

For some reason the wifi on my Mac mini would go out after a few hours, making it impossible to use as a home server (streaming movies and music to my phone and iPad, like a personal Netflix). I've done as much research as I could, and still no solution on how to keep the wifi from going out.

Sometimes fixing the problem requires taking a step back and rethinking the problem entirely. That's when something dawned on me. Instead of fixing that annoying wifi problem, I could eliminate having to use wifi completely. Not sure why I didn't think of this before, but the Mac mini has an Ethernet port, which I could plug in directly to the modem, and the internet would then never go out. Simple, obvious solution for a problem that I've been having for years.
