> Today marks the 100th day since Cyberpunk 2077 was removed from the PlayStation Store after its ignominious launch â€“ and the plans for relisting the game for sale on PS4 and PS5 remain as hazy as they did when the announcement was first made, with both Sony and CD Projekt Red notably silent on the issue.

I remember wanting a PS5 specifically to play Cyberpunk, and hanging on to every update about this upcoming game. They could do no wrong back then. Oh how much a few months can change things.
