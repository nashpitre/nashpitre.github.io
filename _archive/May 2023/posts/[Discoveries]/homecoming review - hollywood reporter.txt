> Employing some of the same destabilizing visual challenges to accepted TV conventions as Mr. Robot does — courtesy once again of Esmail and Emmy-winning director of photography Tod Campbell — Homecoming is a tightly packaged, easily bingeable drama in the (roughly) 30-minute space that tracks a Department of Defense subcontracted experiment (or "initiative") that helps transition soldiers from active duty on the battlefield to normal life back in the States. The series takes place in the present of 2018 and in the near future of 2022, tracking the story of what went wrong at the Homecoming Transitional Support Center in Florida.

If you need me this weekend, I'll be on the couch, eating pizza, watching all 10 episodes of Homecoming, and playing Red Dead Redemption.
