Currently writing a few essays (First one: **[Choose what you pay](pay)**), working in Lake Charles, rebuilding houses from the hurricane damage, doing a digital declutter and deleting 800 gigabytes from iCloud, learning Roam Research and all the benefits of bidirectional linking/thinking, outlining a new album thatâ€™ll release later this year, and preparing for two big purchases coming soon: Apple Watch Series 6 and the PlayStation 5. I also now own a suit.
