# MACV-1: My new boots

I was searching for some shoes that could be worn for everything: work, church, everyday, casual, hiking, camping, traveling — anywheres. I wanted something limitless that could be my only pair of shoes other than my basketball sneakers. And I finally found them. The GoRuck MACV-1.

> The goal was pretty simple: take the most beloved boots in the history of Special Forces, the Vietnam era jungle boots, and modernize ‘em for today’s use. Make ‘em lighter, tougher, with more support -- create the boot at the tip of the spear in places like Syria, Afghanistan, Africa, and in all Special Forces training -- today.
