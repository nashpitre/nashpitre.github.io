# [Anki Reveals Autonomous 'Vector' Home Robot With AI Learning to Help Around the House](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/08/anki-reveals-vector-robot/)

> Once you complete a one-time setup with the connected iOS or Android app, Anki says that all further interactions with Vector are done with eye contact and talking to the robot. Vector is fully autonomous, cloud-connected, and always-on, and has a personality, facial expressions, and animations ("around a thousand") created from a team of animators coming from major studios like Pixar. 

I can't justify spending $250 on this, but I want one. In the future (especially as they get smarter), something like this will become as common as owning a pet.
