I’ve been planning to return with my monthly recaps for awhile now. It took a lot of planning on what a monthly schedule would even look like for me again. Photoblog, videos, church notes, projects, blogs, discoveries. Let’s begin.

## Chris Paul

Suns made the finals. First time in CP’s 16 year career. I have so much more to say on this, but I can’t get the words out right now. For now, I’ll share this tweet I wrote.

## What I’m watching

I loved [No Sudden Move](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt11525644/) on HBO Max. Favorite movie in awhile. [Luca](https://movies.disney.com/luca) was a great Pixar movie for the family. As far as shows, I’m watching [Loki](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt9140554/). Finished [Mare of Easttown](https://www.hbo.com/mare-of-easttown) (also on HBO Max). Highly recommend.
