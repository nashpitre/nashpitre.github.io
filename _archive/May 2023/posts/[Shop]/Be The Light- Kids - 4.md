# It’s actually really simple. *We* make it complicated.

There’s people around us, every day, that we usually just walk pass, with a simple hello and a smile, but we’re not making an impact on their lives. We’re not showing up the way we truly can. Our potential is so much greater than that. There’s broken people. There’s creative people. There’s people that are leaders but were never given a true opportunity to be a leader. There’s people that we meet daily that have an infinite amount of potential, but have shadows of doubt looming over them. We have a special opportunity to bridge that gap.

*The shirt design was inspired by Janea’s [Say Yes To Being Fearless](https://www.bonfire.com/say-yes-to-being-fearless/) shirt. They both were designed by [Amanda Trosclair](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000458017353). I appreciate both of them for everything.*
