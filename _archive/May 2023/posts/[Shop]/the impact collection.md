# Randal Strong

\*\*1 of 4 — [Randal Strong](https://teespring.com/randalstrong?tsmac=store&tsmic=nashp#pid=369&cid=6512&sid=front)\*\*: The first design is for my friend Randal, who's battling cancer, and time seems to be running out for him. The phrase #RandalStrong signifies a fighter, someone who continues to overcome adversity on a daily basis. All proceeds will go to him and his family.

**2 of 4 — [Hero](https://teespring.com/hero-nash?tsmac=store&tsmic=nashp#pid=6&cid=614&sid=front)**: The second design for The Impact Collection is my own special super team: Astro Boy, BB-8, Brayden, Future Trunks, and Link. All proceeds will go to Brayden (which means new Nerf guns and Lego sets).
