	\> Travel is more than just changing location. Itâ€™s changing reality. Changing perspective. Realizing the world you live in, what is your reality, your environment, is formed by many fragile constructs that someone else said is the right way. Travel allows you to see many different ways to live this life, some better, some just different. Mars isn't necessary, just step outside.

	Jordan inspired this shirt, and then wrote a paragraph for me explaining the power of these words.
