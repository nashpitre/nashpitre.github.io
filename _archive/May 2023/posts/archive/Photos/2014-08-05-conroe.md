# Images of Conroe

![writing](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/7df09aprfijt8q_small.jpg)

I've been in Conroe, Texas for the past few days, visiting [family](/carol)â€”and as usual, I'm enjoying the beautiful sceneries here. I want to remember the nuances of this place. There's tons of details that set it apart from Houma. Conroe is a huge city, with interstates and buildings everywhere, but there's also a country aspect to it too. I tried my best to capture as much as possible in a few pictures.

Welcome to Conroe. A city that holds some of my family members. Some live here permanently, while others are here temporally, waiting for the hospital to get it right.

![house](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/hnsmc3jhbmxopq_small.jpg)

This is my Uncle Bill & Nanny's house. It's a small, but homey place to live. I lived here two years ago, and I was very comfortable during my time here. They're about to sell it, so I'm glad that I have this picture of it to remember how nice it was. 

![truck](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/pcu866polnqja_small.jpg)

This is my Uncle Bill's Jeep. If you ever have a chance  to visit him, bring your *old* clothes, because his first question to you will be, *"So watcha doing tomorrow?"*. 

![zilla](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/s5offgfko8dhcg_small.jpg)

This is Zilla. Or Zella. She responds to either, and has officially been named both. 

![porch](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/uroulhe4hpvl9w_small.jpg)

I'll remember this porch for that one night in the summer of 2013, when I started drinking Moonshine and was sleeping 15 minutes later. 

![nanny](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/r2ppffbgpvxxbq_small.jpg)

My Nanny Sheila and Pawpaw Bobby, discussing the doctors that are taking care of [Mawmaw Carol](/carol). 

![chopper](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/2peowljn8mnuw_small.jpg)

His name is Chopper. He says *hello*.


![bridge](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/qh8n3sudekcg_small.jpg)

I walked under this bridge to visit the library. I wanted to walk everywhere I could and experience life slower. I gained a better appreciation for a city that moves very fast.

![chair](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/ijtsvvdd5xuloa_small.jpg)

I've never used this area, but it looks like a great place to start a fire, relax, and share stories about life. 

![bike](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/qcfxrf7ytbhtq_small.jpg)

My Nanny thinks I took pictures of *junk*, but I think this picture has personality. This picture tells a story. But the only story that came out of *this* picture was my Nanny saying, *"I've been telling Bill to pick that shit up."*

![flag](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/q7xl7eeq4ks5w_small.jpg)

Most people take pictures of the flag from a distance, or at an angle where you can see more of it. I wanted to be right underneath the flag, capturing the height of where it flys. 

![danger](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/tylxpljua4quwq_small.jpg)

While walking to the park, I saw a "Danger" sign, with an opening to the woods. It resembled a horror film.

![skate](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/4cwwak0wntdta_small.jpg)

This is a huge skate park with no kids skating. There was a dad though, pushing his daughter around in the stroller, up and down the ramps. They both seemed to be having lots of fun.

![goal](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/mb1itytthnazq_small.jpg)

It doesn't matter what city I go to, I will find basketball goals. Luckily in Conroe, there's great competition. Every day at 6, these courts fill up with 4on4 or 5on5 basketball games.

![books](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/8ydfammryksg_small.jpg)

Books. So many of them. This was taken at Hastings, as I looked around at comics, old Vinyl Records, and *New Arrival* Fiction. I was even greeted by a nice part-time employee that demanded my backpack as I walked into the store.
