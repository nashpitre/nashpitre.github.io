# More personal photoblogs

I’ve gotten robotic with my photoblogs over the years. Just putting my favorites for the month in a monthly post. Nothing personal, just a recap. But these pictures I take have a story to tell or deserve to be separated into something more.

I’ll be aiming to do more with a photoblog, with some writing connected to it. Like this post has.   This should also help these kind of posts be more frequent.

I’ve moving to a different photo editor to do this project too. Something that will inspire me more.
