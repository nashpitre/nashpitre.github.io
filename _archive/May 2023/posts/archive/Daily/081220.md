###### From a remote location, Nash delivers his current thoughts on his life and the world around him. Spending about two hours each day digging through the secret tunnels of the web, what he uncovers is completely unremarkable.

### Journal

Congrats to me: this is the earliest I’ve released this daily post. Still want it sooner than this, but this is a good start. 

It’s time to start playing Death Stranding again. I have a roadmap for video games right now—having to finish each one—that’s running on a tight schedule: Death Stranding. Horizon: Zero Dawn. Mafia One: Definitive Edition. Then...the PlayStation 5 will launch. And the big shoe to drop: Cyberpunk 2077. The game I’ve been waiting a very long time to play.

Still watching a lot of basketball, and that won’t stop any time soon, since the playoffs are about to start next week. Just finished watching Disney Gallery / Star Wars: The Mandalarion. Sunday night, I finished watching HBO’s Perry Mason. Before that, finished both seasons of The Umbrella Academy. A lot of consuming.

Underneath all of this is my thoughts on **What will I create?** These daily workshops aren’t meant to be the only thing I create. It’s only meant to be my notes for the day, as I continue to build bigger projects. My goal is to think through the bigger projects inside of these workshops. It’s taking me longer than expected, but slowly, these daily writings are becoming easier and preparing me to create bigger things. Bare with me.
