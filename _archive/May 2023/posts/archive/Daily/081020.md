### Journal

Today is the day. I spent my vacation knowing that I’d get back to a hard schedule once the vacation was over. So, this morning my alarm was set at 4:45 am, ready to get the day started. I’ve been tracking each hour ever since. I’m still a little rusty at being as productive as I once was, but this system will be the key to getting things going in the right direction again for me. Hour by hour, it’s all accounted for.
