Well, it was fun. Or, it was nice to build a routine again...I don’t know about fun. It served its purpose. I didn’t promote it (mostly because it was more like practice sessions), and it kept evolving. It helped me start a new habit. It helped me study the daily news again. It helped me find my rhythm in writing again. It helped me keep a streak going. And now, it’s over. Here’s the complete [archive](https://nashp.com/tagged/workshop) of what I did for 25 days. Thanks for coming. Now, on to some new projects I have in mind.
