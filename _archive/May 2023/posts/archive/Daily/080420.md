### Journal

*Show up daily.* That’s what I keep thinking as I do these daily news sessions. It’s beginning to evolve into more than just the news. It’ll become my overall location for everything that particular day. In order for this to be sustainable each day, it has to reflect how I live my own life, and how I consume the news.

Currently watching The Umbrella Academy: Season 1 again, before diving into Season 2. Also just watched the first episode of Yellowstone, since my dad seems to love the show. NBA basketball has been on daily for me: tonight: BOS/MIA and HOU/POR. I also saw that Luka just dropped 34, 20, and 12. [^1]
