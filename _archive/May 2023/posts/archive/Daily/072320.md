### Nash’s Notes

I have an opportunity that many others might not have. I’ve been on the internet for what feels like all of my life, and I’m pretty good at it. For others, whether they don't want to do it, don’t know how to do it, or they’re not in a position to dedicate the amount of time it takes to make this, I hope to bridge the gap for them and provide my own take on daily news. I want to dive into topics and articles and study them—and them come out on the other side with more knowledge and information to expand on each topic.

###### I would love your help, but either way, this is about me getting better as a reader and writer. I hope you follow along and join in the [conversation](mailto:nashp@me.com).

### A rant about the state of the internet

I look around online, and all I see is people sharing something someone else posted: a quick emoji, gif, meme, with only a short sentence. The lack of substance continues to shrink, and it’ll only get worse from here. I’m hoping to play a part in bringing detailed information  back to those that are interested in it. There’s only a few of us left. The rest are doing TikTok dances and scrolling past anything that doesn't hold their attention span for more than 10 seconds.

### News/Noise: [$23.99](https://teespring.com/shop/news-noise)

On that note, right before starting on this project an hour ago, I released a random shirt that simple says “News/Noise”. Feel free to [support](https://teespring.com/shop/news-noise) it, or just think about it for a second.

### The News As We Know It

We’re at a point now where we need the most accurate, unbiased information we could possibly get. Information—that right information. I read a lot of books, so most my information comes from there. I also keep up with certain news sites. And recently, I’ve been expanding those sites, as I try to get a better handle on that specific day’s news. Whatever the truth is—in a time like right now—it’s more important than ever. If you have a website or a place that you find very informative, [please get in touch.](mailto:nashp@me.com)

### Five local stories ([HoumaToday](https://www.houmatoday.com/))

- Nicholls [needs](https://www.houmatoday.com/sports/20200722/change-of-plans-nicholls-football-now-looking-for-week-1-opponent) an opponent to play on Sept. 5th, since their previous one, Mississippi Valley state announced that they’ll resume football in the spring, thanks to the pandemic.

- If you’re on the Louisiana coast, you could be looking at as much as 8 inches of [rain](https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20200722/tropical-wave-could-drop-heavy-rain-on-parts-of-la-coast) this weekend. “The system had a 70% chance of developing into a tropical depression in the next two days,” the Hurricane Center said.

- The unemployment fund is dropping by [$50 million a week](https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20200722/louisianarsquos-unemployment-fund-is-dropping-by-50-million-week). ‘Louisiana will have to begin borrowing from the federal government to continue paying benefits.’

- Art After Dark, a popular even each September in Downtown Houma, is now [cancelled this year](https://www.houmatoday.com/lifestyle/20200720/houmarsquos-art-after-dark-festival-wonrsquot-happen-this-year), due to COVID-19, and will return next year.

- State COVID cases continue to rise, and are currently at [90,000](https://www.houmatoday.com/news/20200719/state-covid-cases-exceed-90000-local-cases-rise). ‘Louisiana recorded more than 3,000 new coronavirus cases this weekend.’

### Five sports stories ([ESPN](https://www.espn.com/))

- Washington will be changing its [name](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29460299/how-events-2020-forced-washington-nfl-team-name-change), and they’re doing so faster than anyone could’ve imagined, despite all the intricacies involved in making this happen.

- Basketball’s been finding racism for [decades](https://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/29439678/nba-wnba-players-decade-demanding-justice). The article gives full details on each occurrence and when the league has stood up for what’s right.

- Here’s a full [overview](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29509316/nba-restart-rosters-schedules-standings-projections-every-team) of what’s to come from each team. Their roster, schedule and standings is a great way to look at the current landscape as we head into bubble to finish this season off.

- If you haven’t been following the NFL (like myself), this article gives you a recap of the league’s [offseason](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29510272/2020-nfl-offseason-everything-missed-including-mahomes-extension-brady-tampa-more) and everything that happened since the Super Bowl.

- ESPN takes a look at the current Lakers team and explains why this is LeBron’s [best shot](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29496423/nba-debate-orlando-restart-mean-lebron-james) at another title. The fact is, he’s been resting—not just during the pandemic, but for the first time in forever, he was able to take off last season’s postseason. Now he has AD and a group of other guys that have bought into what the Lakers are trying to do. Having them as the title favor would be a smart bet.

### Five tech stories ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com))

- China has plans for [Mars](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21334654/china-tianwen-1-mars-mission-launch-succssful), Tesla is [building](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334860/tesla-cybertruck-factory-austin-texas-location-model-y) Cybertrucks in the US, AT&T is being slimy once again (using their upcoming 5G network, a network that is many years away from being primary), and scaring their customers into [upgrading](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022) their phones. I don’t think there’s a company that I despise more than AT&T. NYT is [buying](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21335013/the-new-york-times-acquires-serial-productions-podcasts-this-american-life) a podcast studio—the one that brought you Serial, one of the most popular podcast of all time. This is good news, and well deserved. [Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334725/microsoft-q4-2020-earnings-azure-surface-xbox-gains-growth-profits-sales) is hitting its stride with brand identity in several products.

- Finger-pointing and frustration while millions of Americans are set to lose an [economic lifeline](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/congress-unemployment-aid-cliff-378871). “Progressives hate [incrementalism](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/22/progress-settle-medicare-biden-378348), but they’re learning to take what they can get from Joe Biden.” Trump stares down a ticking [economic time bomb](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/17/trump-economy-time-bomb-366871).
