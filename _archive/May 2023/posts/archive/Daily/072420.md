### Nash’s Notes

**All we have is today**. I had that thought earlier, as I was thinking about how I’ll finish up today’s post. It’s currently one in the morning, and I’ve finished everything but this notes section. So let’s begin.

The image above was during an NBA game a few hours before this. I can’t believe it. Finally, NBA is back. Right now, it’s pitch black, with just the light glowing from the two screens. To my left, on the small computer monitor next to me, A Space Odyssey 2001 is playing on mute. He’s about to travel into space. In my ears are the AirPods Pro (full blast), playing Logic’s No Pressure album, which was a released at midnight. Without a doubt, this is the best he’s ever sounded. I wish this wasn't his retirement album, because he sounds extremely sharp. Saying that I’m impressed is an understatement.

Back to how I started this note: **All we have is today.** My goal with these reports is to take a closer look at the world around me. The news, the entertainment, the good and the bad of today. Tt’s all right there at my fingertips. I have a special opportunity to curate it, look at it, understand it more, and then share it with you.

This is day two of making these, and it feels a little easier than yesterday’s. I built a little template (that I’ll continue to tweak) that might help speed it all up too. I’m confident that the process of making these will help me become more efficient at organizing the web, my thoughts and the delivery process. 

So much goes on in a single day. I’ll always have something to talk about. Am I calling them a report? A column? A recap? Whatever. I just know that I’m bringing you the best of each day. I did the digging, so you don’t have to. Let’s see what I found this time.
