### Intro

I spent the entire day working on this post, without actually writing it until the end of the day. I kept thinking about the concept of it: brainstorming on what it is, and what it could be. To sum it up, I’m satisfied with where it’s at, where it’s going, and the initial idea of creating this to begin with. 

I hope you enjoy today’s news.

### Five sports stories

NBA will install 17-foot tall screens on game courts to serve as [digital stands](https://www.cnet.com/news/nba-is-using-microsoft-teams-to-brings-virtual-fans-into-its-real-world-games/) filled with 300 remote fans. NBA plays a leading role during coronavirus pandemic and racial reckoning. Here are the [standings](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29457048/nba-bubble-intel-restart-schedule-standings-latest-news-orlando) heading into the restart. New York Knick’s new head coach: [Tom Thibodeaux](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/29536798/sources-tom-thibodeau-finalizing-5-year-deal-coach-new-york-knicks).

### Five music stories (with more than five links)

I can’t stop thinking about [America](https://youtu.be/OK9EImqaKvI). J. Cole released two new songs ([The Climb Back](https://youtu.be/oVaBgcJwkI4) and [Lion King on Ice](https://youtu.be/MxiSSSa5K2s)). Logic [retired](https://twitter.com/logic301/status/1283905251968536576?s=21) from rapping—to be a ‘great father’, released a [new album](https://genius.com/albums/Logic/No-pressure) right after the announcement, and before that, signed an exclusive [seven-figure deal](https://www.ign.com/articles/logic-quits-rap-to-stream-on-twitch-exclusively) with Twitch. Just downloaded a new app called [Soor](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/soor-2-review-magic-mixes-and-release-alerts-elevate-the-beautiful-apple-music-client/), which has magic mixes and and many other features worth trying. Taylor Swift also surprised us with a new album that ‘[reset her image](https://www.vox.com/culture/21337131/taylor-swift-folklore-image)’. I like the [song](https://youtu.be/osdoLjUNFnA) with Bon Iver.

### Five film stories

Regis Philbin [dies](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/regis-philbin-dead-dies-1234716557/) at 88. Letterman called Regis a ‘[master communicator](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/25/entertainment/regis-philbin-appreciation/index.html)’. Could Zack Snyder’s version of Justice League be a [series](https://screenrant.com/justice-league-snyder-cut-movie-tv-show-format/) instead of a movie? Apple looking to [acquire](https://www.fastcompany.com/90531251/apple-eyes-new-streaming-strategy-after-tom-hanks-drama-breaks-records) more blockbuster movies after success of ‘Greyhound’. The Streaming Wars are here. Hopefully [this](https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/5/29/21263715/hbo-max-peacock-netflix-hulu-disney-plus-amazon-apple-cbs-all-access-streaming-service-guide) makes it easier.

### Five political stories

Donald Trump’s suburban [horror show](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/25/trumps-suburban-nightmare-376823). Republican Party could suffer its worst defeat in the suburbs in decades. Make America [normal](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/24/trump-backers-plead-virus-plan-381316) again: a plea for a virus plan. When the job got hard, he got [bored](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/07/when-the-job-got-hard/). Corporate America was here for you on coronavirus [until about June](https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-economy-recession-stock-market/2020/7/24/21334368/pandemic-related-perks-benefits-disappearing-essential-workers-starbucks-covid-19). U.S. tops 1,000 coronavirus deaths 4 days in a row as experts urge the country to [shut down](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/26/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html). (Following politics just for this section is depressing.)

### Outro

It’s Saturday, which means something different to this project. It left me questioning the schedule of these post. Should I post on the weekends too? Should I post the news of yesterday, even though the date is today (like I did the last two days)? Or should I work on this during the day and make it about that day (not the day before)? Should I work on these Monday through Friday, and take the weekends off? These are the things I was thinking of today, not just for today, but the project as a whole: what should the schedule be? I’m thinking only weekdays going forward. We’ll see.
