Curate to create. Basically exactly what this page is.

Apple’s AR/VR is coming. I feel the same way about this category that I did with the Watch and AirPods before they launched.

Half-Life Alyx is a game that you have to experience one day. It’s the first VR experience that blew me away. Hope it comes to PSVR.

Uncharted 4. Such a beautiful game. Still.

Meta (Facebook) is waiting for Apple so they can copy. Reminds me of when Android completely changed how Android looked once the iPhone launched.

I don’t know much about NFTs yet, but if it allows artist like myself to turn what they build into money, how can you be against it?

AirPods Max. Too expensive for me. And I can’t justify them. I love the AirPod Pros too much. They’re in my ears 90% of the day. But I did get to experience the Max once when going into an Apple store. Completely immersive sound.
