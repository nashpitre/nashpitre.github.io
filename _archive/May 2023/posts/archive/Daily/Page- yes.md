# Building a Dispatch System

![](https://i.imgur.com/xDzDvO8.jpg)

I spent way too much time today building this [Dispatch](t) system. I even beta tested it with a few people to see how it was working for them. Through a few iterations, I’ve come up with something that’s sustainable.

It started with me going through each favorited tweet and seeing what is worth keeping. Simple process, and very inspiring to see a week’s worth of the best content in one place. I then take that tweet and giving it a description above it. The description helps me give my own thoughts on the tweet, but behind the scenes, it helps me know what this random link is under it. So it works for the two things.

This system started as just one page with over 70 tweets embedded on it. It’s no wonder that page was buggy and had trouble loading.

The system I ended up with was one public page that will act as the table of contents, with dispatch pages that are private (hidden unless you know the link). Those links will be listed on the table of contents page as they’re updated.

I think this gives me a process that allows several things:

- One landing page to get to each date
- Hidden pages so they’re not making the site’s RSS noisy
- Separate pages that give me a clean slate each day
- Separate pages to break up the embeds to prevent the site from being buggy
- Simple link system (t, t1, t2, t3, etc.).
