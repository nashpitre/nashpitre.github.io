###### From a remote location, Nash delivers his current thoughts on his life and the world around him. Spending about two hours each day digging through the secret tunnels of the web, what he uncovers is completely unremarkable.

### Journal

It’s Friday. Another work week has passed for us. We made it! These past few days have been a weird change of pace for me. My body is getting used to new routines and new medicine. I did more sleeping than usual. My mood kept shifting. But there were new habits that I kept up with, as I try to rebuild a system for myself. Always working from home makes complacency creep it, and that’s what I’ve been trying to fight. Waking up at 5 am every morning, interval running at 5:30, and then digesting the internet to write about it and process it—these things are just the beginning of something bigger for me. I look forward to an eventful but relaxing weekend, and to improve next week and build on what I did this week. See you soon.

### News

I just discovered [poolside.fm](https://poolside.fm/). My life is complete.

The biggest [news](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368504/fortnite-apple-google-app-store-brief-incomplete-timeline) right now is how Epic Games is using its popularity and leverage to shift the power of distributing video games on mobile devices. I’m fascinated by this. This news carries over from yesterday, but it’s that big. Who would’ve thought that a video game for kids would be Apple’s biggest challenge. Not sure how much will change, but Epic’s approach to taking on Goliath was brilliantly executed.

The Blazers have made the cut. Dame said he wasn’t entering the bubble unless he had a chance to compete in the playoffs, and then he went and backed it up—a team that was out of the playoffs fought it’s way in. The ‘Play-In Tournament’ (8th seed versus 9th seed, a new wrinkle for this year’s playoffs) start tomorrow. Blazers against the Grizzlies. Winner of that little tournament will face the Lakers Tuesday.

The Suns went into the bubble with everyone counting them out. They had to play 8 games. They won all 8 games, the only undefeated team during these 8 seeding games. That still wasn’t enough. They were too far back. Even going undefeated, they needed the Grizzlies or Blazers to lose one more for them to get in. Still, very impressive run by them. [^1]
