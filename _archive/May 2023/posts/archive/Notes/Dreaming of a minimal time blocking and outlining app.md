# Time blocking and outlining

I’m imagining a simple app that has a few features:

- Calendar/Time Blocking
- Note taking/Outlining

---- 

That’s a brief overview of what it’ll do, but let me explain more:

- Today’s date at the top
- a timeline for each hour of the day
- A line showing where current time is on that timeline
- The option to time block what each hour’s job is for that day
- When time blocking for the hour, what you write there gets added to your calendar app
- The option to create bullet lists and outline inside of the current time
- Those notes and bullet lists aren’t added to calendar, but are instead surfaced only when searching for a word that was written

---- 

These ideas come from several apps:

- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)
- [Structured](https://structured.today/)
