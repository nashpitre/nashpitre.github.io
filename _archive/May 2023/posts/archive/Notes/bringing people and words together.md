# What I'm Currently Working On (Bringing People And Words Together)

Ideas are pouring out of me right now. It feels like a good time for me to document all of this. If any of these things interest you, please get in touch, and let me know specifically about the one you're excited about—and don't forget to sign up for the newsletter on my site, which will email you the second I release a big project.

## Small Groups

- **Creative Minds Small Group**: a Saturday night get together, for creative minds, who need help with their work, would like to share something they're working on, or someone who just needs to be around other like-minded people.

- **BBQ & Basketball Small Group**: a Sunday afternoon get together, for families who enjoy hanging out at a park or a gym, eating good food, and hanging out with other great people from the community.

## Music

For those keeping track, I've recorded 39 songs so far this year. The album I've been working on for the past few months has been put on hold for a week or two. I started noticing that I had enough songs that didn't fit the concept of the album, so those songs will become its own project this week. If all goes well, the first week of August will be when I release the album I'm about to mention.

- **The Land of Unfamiliar**: I'll be taking you on a journey. The Land of Unfamiliar is a small story I'll be telling through a collection of songs, that document my transition to the unknown.

- **Pilot**: if you're paying close attention then you already know about this one. It's my next big album. I usually don't tell anyone the name of an upcoming album, I prefer it to just arrive, but because of this post explaining everything I'm currently up to, it's only right that I let this one out the bag too. I'm expecting this one to be out in a few months, after about a dozen more studio sessions, and once everything else falls in place.

- **The Mask: Bonus Cuts**: one long track with all the pieces that didn't make [The Mask](http://nashp.com/mask) album. (This is something I decided to do when I was gathering all the songs for the projects I just mentioned. It was at that time that I realized how much good music was left on the table. This song will have over 10 songs that weren't used. It won't be anything significant as far as launching—it'll just be added to [The Mask](http://nashp.com/mask) page when I'm done with it. If this is something you're interested in, either let me know directly, or keep checking [The Mask](http://nashp.com/mask) page in the near future. I won't promote it any other way.
