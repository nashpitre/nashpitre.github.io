# Summer Project: 2018

![](https://i.imgur.com/I2x4Sc7.jpg)


It’s been a busy season for me. The summer will be over soon, and I’ve been too busy to even notice it. So, in order to fix this, I’m doing what I do best: turn it it into a project.

I have a bunch of little things—random, odd, fun ideas—that I’d like to do in the next few weeks (8 weeks to be exact, that’s when summer is officially over—September 22nd, fact-checked by Google). This project will be a document of victory that declares, *“Even though I was “too busy”, I did something during the Summer of 2018”.*

And I’d like you to join me.

## There’s three important requirements that first have to be met before officially being able to join this group:

- You like food
- You like fun
- You like me
