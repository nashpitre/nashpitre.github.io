### Using [Sofa](sofa) app to keep up with my backlog of things to watch.

## November 2021

- Squid Game
- Industry
- Dave

Squid Game was a cross between Black Mirror, The Hunger Games, and Saw. I enjoyed it the whole time.

## October 2021

- Dave Chappelle - The Closer
- Dune
- The White Lotus

Dave Chappelle’s The Closer was the powerful thing I’ve seen it in awhile. People will walk away saying it’s hilarious. I walked away amazed by the way he thinks, collects thoughts, and then conveys them to the world.

Dune is one of the best movies I’ve watched in a long time. Denis Villeneuve’s style of directing, combined with the rich story from the Dune novels, makes this movie feel like it’s way before our time *and* way after it.
