# Working on my return

#### Warning. I’m writing this to give you a heads up: I'm gearing up to start writing again. A lot. Let me know if there's a topic that you're most interested in me covering. Even if it's something outside of my usual topics—I'll study it and make sure to cover it with as much detail as possible. Please, give me homework. Just comment in the private message box. Leave contact info if you want me to get back to you.

It's been a weird year for me (as well as for the rest of the world). But for me, I set myself up to be completely still regardless. This started in January. I removed myself from the noise of the world in every way possible. It just so happened that the whole world froze with me. Maybe that's why this COVID situation and staying home doesn't bother me like it does others. I wanted a season of rest. I wanted to take a break from the rapid speed I was moving in. This year—with COVID, with fasting twice, with being bedridden from a broken bone, and then with moving to a new home twice—I haven't been thinking about writing or creating as much as I usually do. I have thoughts, but I have yet to expand on them. That'll change soon though.

I've built out a new writing structure for me to use as templates: this will allow topics to pour out steadily once I kick things off. I've also built a separate computer that stays on, on my counter (just a tiny screen and a wireless keyboard), and it stays with an empty text box, waiting for me to start writing. The text box is connected to this website, so after I write, it's public. Best of all, it’s only a $35 computer. I'll be talking about it soon. It's the cheapest way to get into writing, and it can even get as low as $10. I'll nerd out and explain this in the near future.

But for now, I'm wrapping up a few things for work, preparing for a 10 day vacation/road trip (Just bought a GoPro Hero 8, so videos are about to start coming out again, for these upcoming vacations, for music videos, for daily vlogs). But besides that, there's only two things on my radar: basketball and writing. See you soon.
