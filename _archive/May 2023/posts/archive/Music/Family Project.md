# Family (Alpha)

![](https://images.pexels.com/photos/3289156/pexels-photo-3289156.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-alex-fu-3289156.jpg&fm=jpg)

I’ve been brainstorming on a new project called Family. Making an album of all the songs I’ve previously made that reference my family. I’ll start by adding all the songs that match this concept, but then narrow it down to just the ones that flow well together. 

## Current list of songs

- Family (Satellite)
- Dear Momma (One Man Army)
- For My Brother 3
- Flickering Lights (PlasticSky)
- This Is My Family (The Great Escape)
- Heaven on Earth (The Great Escape)
- Carol (The Hero Dies)
- For My Brother 2
- Your Sobriety (How We See The World)
- When The Heart’s Involved (How We See The World)
- For My Brother 1
- I Hope (The Loop)
- The Void: Dad
- Diary of a School Girl (Landing Gear)
- When I’m Gone (The Land of Unfamiliar)
