# New Album (need your help)

![](https://i.imgur.com/x1ntj8T.png)

In less than a week, I’ve recorded a new album. It’s incredible, and it’s almost done. Now I want to fill in the rest of the holes with layers of your voice. If you’re an artist, designer, painter, singer, rapper, poet, OR just someone who would like to send me a voice memo about your story or something you’re currently going through or you’ve overcome, I’d love for you to join me. This album is bigger than me. This is a story about all of us. A story about mental health. About climbing mountains. About getting knocked down and rising up again and again. It’s called the The Illusion of Progress, and God has put it on my heart to have you involved in the process.
