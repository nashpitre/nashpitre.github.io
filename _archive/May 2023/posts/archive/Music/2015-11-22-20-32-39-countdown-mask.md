# Countdown to The Mask

I have the next four days off from work, so I'll use that time to finish and release an album I've been working on since May. It's called The Mask, and it's the darkest project I've ever made.

Looks like it'll have 7 (maybe 8) songs on it (not counting all the hidden songs behind certain tracks). I could've spent many more months polishing it up and making it even better, but it feels like that chapter of my life is done and I'll no longer be able pull inspiration from that story. So, I'll wrap up what I currently have, clean up all the rough edges, and give it to you Wednesday night.
