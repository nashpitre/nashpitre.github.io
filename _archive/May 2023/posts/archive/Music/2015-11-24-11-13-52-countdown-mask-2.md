# Countdown to The Mask (part two)

A little over 24 hours before I release The Mask. The past 48 hours has been me cleaning up any rough edges, and also testing out a few ideas to see if a last minute song will make the cut. But for the most part, the album is complete.

I just got back from Starbucks, and now I'm building out a to-do list for all the last minute things needed to be done. It's like packing for a big trip: no matter how much you plan for the departure, those final hours always come with tons of empty check boxes. 

In a few hours, I'll be at the dentist, unfortunately getting two root canals. Some time this afternoon, when the pain settles, I'll get back to work and finish up the album.

Almost there!
