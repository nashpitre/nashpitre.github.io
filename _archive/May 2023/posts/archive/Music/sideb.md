---- 

One track, 20 minutes long. A collaboration, with darkness, and with Boy Once Blind. Only come inside if you're looking for chaos: words flying in every direction, background music constantly switching, spoken word gets interrupted by rapid verses. There's no peace here, only a dark world, with perspectives from those that have seen too much.
