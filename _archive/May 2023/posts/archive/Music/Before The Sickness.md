There's discomfort in my heart today. I’ve spent the year with absolute peace. But today, something is bothering me. So, I’d like to write and tell a story.

Before COVID-19 was ever a thing, I had this idea of a fictional album. The album title is “**When The Satellite Fell**”. A story about the aftermath of a catastrophe.
