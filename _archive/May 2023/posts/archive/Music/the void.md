# The Void

Emily Gilcrease:

> The only constant thing in the world is change. You change your behavior, your mindset, your thoughts, your outlooks, your habits, and still the void. You change your music, your style, the places you visit, what you do in your free time, and still the void. The void is constant, it's the voice in your head telling you to try harder, or don't. When will the void be filled? What does it have in store? For the void, for now, is what's controlling your happiness.

Dear God,

Let’s have a conversation. I been losing my patience. I been forgetting to thank you. I can’t find peace. I make everything about me.

> The Illusion of Progress

How you doing? Welcome back to the music. I’m climbing out of the ruins with nothing but lighter fluid. I’ll show you how to do it. I ignite myself. When it all falls down, I just remind myself. You been here before, it’s all familiar. Close your eyes to remember. Breadcrumbs will bring you back to the center. Your heart is racing, slow down the tempo. When you’re lost, you’re gonna find it in Him, so

Dear God,

Let’s have a conversation. I been losing my patience. I been forgetting to thank you. I can’t find peace. I make everything about me. When it’s not about me, but I’m selfish. I can’t help it.

Dear God,

Let’s have a conversation. I been losing my patience. I been forgetting to thank you. I can’t find peace. I make everything about me. It's apparent that I'm lost, as I'm staring at the..

Dear Lord,
  
Give me your wisdom and vision. Grant me the serenity. This is bigger than my comprehension. You know my heart. You see the anxiety inside of me. Can you take that out of me? It’s not the best side of me. Renew my spirit and my energy. I’m my worst enemy. Grant me the serenity. Restore my inner peace. Show me I’m not by myself. When It all falls down I’ll know I got your help.

Dear God,

Let’s have a conversation. I been losing my patience. I been forgetting to thank you. I can’t find peace. I make everything about me. When it’s not about me, but I’m selfish. I can help it.

Dear God,

Let’s have a conversation. I been losing my patience. I been forgetting to thank you. I can’t find peace. I make everything about me. It's apparent that I'm lost, as I'm staring at the cross.
