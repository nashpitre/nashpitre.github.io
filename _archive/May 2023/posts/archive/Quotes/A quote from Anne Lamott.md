# A quote from Anne Lamott: 'little gods or sorcerers'

> Ever since I was a little kid, I've thought that there was something noble and mysterious about writing, about the people that could do it well, who could create a world as if they were little gods or sorcerers. All my life I've felt that there was something magical about people who could get into other people's minds and skin, who could take people like me out of ourselves and then take us back to ourselves.
