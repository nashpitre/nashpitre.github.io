# [The Ocean At The End Of The Lane](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane)

Neil Gaiman:

> I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy.
