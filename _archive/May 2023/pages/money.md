# Money

![](https://i.imgur.com/u4jpHYb.png)

#### Every month, I go through each service that’s connected to nashp.com — [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2TD5VY7SNQGK9?ref_=wl_share), [consulting](help), [memberships](member), [merchandise](/shop), [album sales](/music), [Donations](https://www.paypal.me/nashpitre), etc. — and when transferring those little balances into my bank account, and seeing them collectively become a small paycheck, it’s always fascinating. A bunch of little buckets working together for the bigger picture. Thank you.

# [Consulting](help)

I want to help you become better. Whether it’s a project you’re working on, and you’d like to maximize its potential, or if it’s some family pictures that you’re afraid to lose. Your passwords are probably the same on every website, or even worse, you can never remember your passwords. Maybe you have an idea for a song, but have no clue what to do next. Maybe you have all these ideas and you’d like to start your own blog. No matter the problem, I’m hoping to have the solution. There’s particular skills that I specialize in, and I’d like to help you with each one of them.

# [Membership](https://nashp.memberful.com/checkout?plan=27836)

### Why become a [member](https://nashp.memberful.com/checkout?plan=27836)? To Invest.

The membership doesn’t give you any perks, discounts, or bonuses. It’s an investment. It’s for those that want to see me tell more stories. They want more albums, more videos, and more books. It’s for those that want the things I create to become my full-time job. They believe in me enough to become a member.

The [membership](https://nashp.memberful.com/checkout?plan=27836) is a yearly contribution to support all things created on nashp.com. There’s no pressure to join. If you feel like I’ve brought you enough value, then join. Otherwise, I’ll keep working.

A little shop where I experiment and sell physical products. Shirts, decals, coffee mugs, stickers, bags, phone cases, and more.

The quickest way to show your support and send me money.

# [Amazon Wish List](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2TD5VY7SNQGK9?ref_=wl_share)

There’s things in life that you want, or even need, but never get around to buying them for yourself. These are those things. It’s my Amazon Wish List. This [link](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2TD5VY7SNQGK9?ref_=wl_share) will allow you to buy it for me and it’ll ship to my address. Weird. But it works.
