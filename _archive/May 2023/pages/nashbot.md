**Job 1**: Design a cute robot that looks like studio ghibli, wearing goggles, working on code, and writing on a keyboard. White background.

**Job 2**: Sum up this page.

> Introducing #nashbot, my website assistant! It's a combination of AI apps like Midjourney, DiffusionBee and Open AI’s ChatGPT. I gave it years worth of ideas to see how it reacts, and what it gave back was astonishing. As a one-man operation, having a bot assist me feels like science-fiction, and I plan to use it as such. Excited to see how AI enhances my creative projects!♢

## Welcome

I’ve hired an assistant to help me with my website. For help with writing, designing, and structuring. Best part? This assistant isn’t human. It’s a combination of apps that I’ll collectively call **nashbot**.

The services I’m currently using are [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com), [DiffusionBee](https://diffusionbee.com/) and Open AI’s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), but as this space grows, the apps will continue to evolve.

## Why

As of writing this, I gave the bot years worth of ideas I’ve written to see how it reacted. With it opened up next to my writing projects, and feeding it a variety of topics, what it gave back to me was astonishing.

As a one-man operation, having a bot assist me with important parts of my work feels right. It feels like science-fiction at times, and I plan to use it as such. 

I’ll be blurring the lines between what’s real and what’s fiction, similar to how I’ve always approached my [music](/music).

This is just the beginning, and I’m excited to see how my creative projects are enhanced by artificial intelligence.
