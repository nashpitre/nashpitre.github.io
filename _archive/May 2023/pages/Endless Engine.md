###### A place for Endless projects. A private page for administration.

## Caption Refresh

- Scrap the on photo idea
- Underneath photo is fine
- Using h5 would be a good idea
- Allowing me to write out sentences about a photo and it not take up a lot of space

## Expand/Collapse

- Build a /blog with pagination
- Add pill to top of /blog
- Add pill to top of /archive
- Left side of pill says Expand
- Right side of pill says Collapse
- The side you’re on is colored in (like header does)

## Build Theme Duplicate


- Name current theme “Endless Legacy”
- Name new theme “E1”
- Move what’s being used to new theme
- Leave old theme alone
- Reason — on this current theme, things deleted keep coming back.

## Buttondown Project

- Plan for Monday Coffee to be sent from here
- Build theme to match website
- Remove everything from footer
