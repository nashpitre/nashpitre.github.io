# Shop

![](https://i.imgur.com/u4jpHYb.png)

##### Every month, I go through each service that’s connected to nashp.com — Amazon, Patreon, merchandise, album sales, donations, etc. — and when transferring those little balances into my bank account, and seeing them collectively become a small paycheck, it’s always fascinating. A bunch of little buckets working together for the bigger picture. Thank you.

# [Merchandise](merch)

A little shop where I experiment and sell physical products. Shirts, decals, coffee mugs, stickers, bags, phone cases, and more.

There’s things in life that you want, or even need, but never get around to buying them for yourself. These are those things. It’s my Amazon Wish List. This [link](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2TD5VY7SNQGK9?ref_=wl_share) will allow you to buy it for me and it’ll ship to my address. Weird. But it works.

# [Album Sales](music)

Th oldest way that I’ve made money from my site, but still one of the most popular: [buying an album](music). I’ve released over 20 albums over the last two decades.
