# The Traveling Drone (Morning Coffee: October 3rd, 2022)

###### I’m in Mandeville this morning. Helping out with some drone work and shooting a commercial. Always interesting trying to write while traveling. Let’s begin.

## The Traveling Drone

Spent the day working with cameras, drones, and microphones. It’s always a treat when I get to do this kind of work. Even more so when it’s out of town. Networking, building relationships, and offering my talents to the world. It’s what I was born to do.

## Simplified weather

I recently switched [CARROT Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather-alerts-radar/id961390574) to a very simple look: the current weather on top, with the next 72 hours trailing underneath. Nothing else. As I scroll through those 72 hours, I watch the temperature snake from hot to cold, I watch the sun go down, and I notice when the icon goes from sun to rain. A very clean and simple way to monitor the weather.

## Sofa

[Sofa](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1276554886) remains one of my favorite apps on the iPhone. I recently cleaned up my lists, getting it back down to just the essentials. Three main lists (TV, Movies, and Games), with a section titled “Collections” underneath.  

Collections is where I make cool personalized lists for things that are connected. Like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, or all of Christopher Nolan’s films.
