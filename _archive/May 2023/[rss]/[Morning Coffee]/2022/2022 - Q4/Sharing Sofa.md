###### Good morning. I’m writing you from a private office above the coffee shop. A new inspiring place to think and create. Keeping it simple this week. Writing about some custom screens and some collections I’ve built this past year. [Let’s begin](mailto:nashp@me.com).

## Home Screens

[Dark Hue](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6443841256) and [Mercury](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1621800675) are the two apps that are featured on my Lock Screen, wallpaper, and watch face.

- [Dark Hue](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6443841256) gives me the gradient trimming around my wallpaper on the iPhone. Makes the home screen look like it’s glowing.

- [Mercury](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1621800675) is my new favorite weather app.  I like that it’s widgets shows only four hours. Has a cleaner look.

## Sharing Sofa

I’ve been building collections in [Sofa](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sofa-downtime-organizer/id1276554886) for awhile now. Making lists of different types of content, connecting dots, and organizing thoughts. Now, Sofa has the ability to share those lists with others. Here’s just a few of them. 

Install [Sofa](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sofa-downtime-organizer/id1276554886), then click one of these list to add it to your collection:

- [Quentin Tarantino](https://www.icloud.com/share/0d1DxN40FMCrC3s-RqMM6yDvw#Quentin_Tarantino_)
- [The Legend of Zelda](https://www.icloud.com/share/031aqbTuzvuGVGGcObtudbPyw#The_Legend_of_Zelda)
- [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://www.icloud.com/share/05dj-xQUqBztqhMYsmflDzoFQ#Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)
- [Denis Villenueve](https://www.icloud.com/share/07fuAi7XqygZJbqAFIld8LwbA#Denis_Villenueve)
