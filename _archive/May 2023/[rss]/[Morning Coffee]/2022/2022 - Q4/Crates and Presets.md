## Darkroom Presets

[Darkroom](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746) has been my favorite photo editing app for years now. This past week, they [released](https://darkroom.co/blog/2022-10-preset-sharing) an update that allows us to share the presets we’ve built. Digging around their [Twitter](https://twitter.com/usedarkroom/status/1580570901057130497) account, you’ll see all the presets others have built. This is the easiest way to make your photos look good. 

Here’s the presets I used for the four photos above (install the app, then click these links): 

- [Glass Pop](https://darkroom.co/preset/6BCE3248-694F-4209-AC84-61AD58B10B0A)
- [AV4](https://darkroom.co/preset/D9E6C4FC-D46F-474F-A8F3-02342688C3F3)
- [Natura](https://darkroom.co/preset/302D9C13-78B0-4EF8-9FC1-526B33CA10F4)
- [VSCO A9](https://darkroom.co/preset/623D7699-F49A-4420-83F8-2E984171FC8D)

## Crate Nightstands

A few months ago, we stayed at an Airbnb, and they had crates as nightstands. I’ve been looking for similar ones ever since.

I finally found the ones I wanted, and now each side of the bed has two stacked on top of each other.

On my side, books, Hypervolt, Kindle, wooden box for my ring and AirPods, and a holder for my glasses. All the things I usually keep near the bed. 

I’m enjoying the minimal yet functional setup we now have.
