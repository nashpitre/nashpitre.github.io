# (Monday Coffee: July 4th, 2022)

---- 

###### This week went by way too fast. Feels like I was just writing the previous newsletter. That’s what traveling and vacation does to your days. I’m writing you from my Downtown Jeaux headquarters. Today I brought my family with me. I’d like to not split these two times up, and instead, spend time with them while I write this. Hoping it could be something that flows well together. As I’m writing this, I look up from the screen to see Olivia feeding Rose her breakfast. She’s beautiful. Let’s begin.

## Traveling with Olivia

I spent most of last week traveling with my wife. To New Orleans and then Biloxi, using Airbnb. A simple roadtrip with no real ternary. It was just a few days, but it felt much longer. It was a nice getaway for us. It showed us that you can pickup and go have fun even if it’s just for a day or two. It doesn’t have to be a whole week scheduled off. Hoping to do something similar very soon. Getting away for just a day.

## Work Life Balance

Since that trip, I’ve been thinking a lot about how I’m balancing my time. I’m being spread too thin, and each area of my life is suffering from it. It’s time to focus on scheduling my time better. Putting space between each area.

## Update on Time Tracking

It’s been an interesting few weeks with attempting to time track. What I’ve learned is something I expected to happen: It’s easy to time track when it’s all you’re focused on. But when life gets busy, remembering to log each thing never happens. I’ll find new ways to correct this. I knew this would be a work in progress, so now I’m adjusting accordingly. The two new things I’ll try this week is first, frequent alarms that sound off and remind me to log the day so far, and second, writing the time tracking in Field Notes really quick so I can get back to what I’m doing.

## About Minimalism

I’ve been thinking a lot about the things I own lately. I remember when I only owned 50 items in total. That’s much easier to do without a wife and kid. I’m scared to know what the number is now, and it’s way too much to even try to count. I don’t expect to get down to that number again. As a homeowner, you obviously need more things. But I can still declutter and find the essentials for each area in the house. That’ll be a focus of mine going forward.

## Instagram

I spent some time last week working on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nashpitre). Getting the Story Highlights to have a simple and clean look. I wanted all the icons to white with a black icon. I also wanted to make recaps for each month.

## Sit Fixes

I stopped in the Apple store last week, went to my website to see how it looked on a big screen, and I didn’t like what I saw. My site is built for smaller screens, and it shows. The site width and the header having scroll bars will be the first fixes.
