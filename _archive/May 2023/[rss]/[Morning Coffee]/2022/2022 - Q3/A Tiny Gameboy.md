## Miyoo Mini

I’ve been looking for something to play old school games on for awhile now. I tried adding them to my phone, but I didn’t like the experience (plus I don’t need one more thing to use my phone for). Then I then thought about buying the original Gameboy, but knew that I’d have to buy all the old cartridges for each game too.

What I settled on, after tons of research, is the Miyoo Mini. All my favorite retro games, from Nintendo, Super Nintendo, Gameboy, Gameboy Advance, and Sega Genesis, are saved onto an SD card and now with me everywhere I go.

The Miyoo is as small as a deck of playing cards, much smaller than I expected, and easily fits in my pocket.

## Notion

Another week, another update on organizing data. I’ve been studying [Notion](http://notion.so), learning how to build databases, and I’ve went to the extreme and started adding every aspect of my life in here. This is allowing me to learn how to build a database for a variety of situations. Everything from clients, bills, shows I’m watching, progress on games, writing queue, and even the things I own. I’m learning that there’s not much that doesn’t fit in a table.
