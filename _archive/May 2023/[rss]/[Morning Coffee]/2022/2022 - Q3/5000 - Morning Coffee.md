###### Just arrived at Downtown Jeaux. Listening to [The Technicolors](https://youtu.be/6R6b1DWooGM). Small Americano. Last week’s newsletter launch was a success. No hiccups. Love the way it looks in the inbox now. Hoping to improve on that process this week and become even more efficient. Let’s begin.

## Hip-Hop Night

Last week, I went [shoot photos](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE4MTY1OTE1NDEyMjQ2OTMx?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) in New Orleans for the day. Artists from New York came down to perform, and I captured their day and then the performance. I ended up with 5,000 photos. Now I’ll be spending the next two weeks editing and delivering those photos.

## Building a Database

I’ve spent the last two weeks building a database (and a workflow) for freelance work. Starting from scratch, doing lots of research, and seeing what works and what doesn’t. I’ve tried several systems, haven’t landed on one just yet, but it’s been an interesting journey. I have an idea on where I want to arrive at, hopefully I get there soon.

## Apple Music: For You

A lot of people don’t know that Apple Music creates weekly mixes for you, based on the type of music you’ve been listening to. Each time you listen to something, you’re training these mixes to become better. Chill Mix and Get Up! Mix. Those are my two favorite to use.
