# System Thinking (Morning Coffee: September 26th)

###### Listening to [The Hum Goes On Forever](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-hum-goes-on-forever/1627556654) on repeat this morning. Just finished writing this week’s newsletter. I feel myself getting better (even though I wake up on Mondays wondering what I’ll write about). [Let me know how I’m doing](mailto:nashp@me.com).

## System Thinking

I’ve been on a journey for months now with building out new systems. It continues to feel like new adventures each week. Organizing all the different areas of my life. I’ve been able to zoom in on a specific problem, and then shape it to exactly how I want it to look.

The more I do this, the more it all makes sense. The more it makes sense, the more I can teach it to someone else. And the more I teach it to someone else, the more I learn myself. A loop. This system thinking has opened my eyes to new ways to understand information.

## 1Password

[1Password](https://1password.com/) is an app that I used many years ago, and I just recently decided to return to it. It’s been on the agenda for awhile now, to update all my passwords, making sure each password is different, stronger, and longer than the password before it. 1Password gives me the opportunity to clean house and keep my digital life secure and organized.

## Things

[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) continues to be one of my favorite apps to use every day. It takes what’s on the agenda for today and makes it look clean and easy to achieve. I recently added a little more structure to fit this current season of my life. I built areas that I can easily throw tasks into, so when looking at the Today view, it’s all sectioned off and compartmentalized.
