###### Just arrived at Downtown Jeaux. Americano and MacBook. After writing this, we’ll be headed to New Orleans for the day. Let’s begin.

## Dancing with the Stars

Two nights ago, I had the opportunity to work for [Junior Auxiliary of Houma’s Dancing With The Stars](http://jaofhouma.com/dwts). I had one camera filming the entire performance on a tripod, while another camera was taking the photos (Chase had another camera on a gimbal, filming as he moved around). I ended the night with over 1,500 photos that I’ll be editing this week.

## One App, One Job

I’m constantly studying new apps and systems. I keep thinking there’s a perfect app that can handle every single area of my life. I’m  slowly learning that that’s the wrong way of thinking, and I should embrace the power of multiple apps.

Instead of each area of my life separated by folders in the same app, that separation is now in a completely different app. This is allowing me to be more nimble with my thinking and organizing. Now, when I notice that one app is handling multiple jobs, I’m brainstorming on what different app, that doesn’t have a job yet, could handle that workload.

I’m still early in my thinking with this, and I’ll probably expand on this better down the road, but I figured I’d share what I have now anyway.
