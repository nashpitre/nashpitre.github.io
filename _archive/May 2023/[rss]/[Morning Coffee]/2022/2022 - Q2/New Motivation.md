# New Motivation (Monday Coffee: May 16th, 2022)

###### Starting this week’s writing session off later than usual today. Brought my little brother to school, cleaned up around the house, fed Rose her bottle and put her to sleep. Now I’m at Downtown Jeaux preparing for today’s newsletter. Listening to [Morning Focus](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/morning-focus/pl.a0d4254c599b4ee49b068a90852618e0) on Apple Music. I have a few topics that I’ll be covering today. Hoping this one will be shorter than the last few weeks, so I can spend most of my free time today doing photography. Let’s begin.

## New Motivation

This is the start of a new chapter. A chapter that began a few weeks ago, but is in full effect now. This chapter is focused on the camera. On the editing. On the paying photo jobs I’ve been scheduling. On time management. On health. Getting faster. Getting stronger. This chapter is focused on all the new opportunities that have been popping up lately. Making sure there’s enough mental space to give each one my full attention. Being able to compartmentalize each part of my life, ensuring that each part is thriving. No area left behind. I’ll be 36 next week. It’s time to take that next leap forward.

## Photoblogs

I released two photoblogs last week. One on the [12th](https://nashp.com/051222), one on the [13th](https://nashp.com/051322). Each day I spent the day learning the camera and finding interesting subjects to capture. Expect a consistent amount of photoblogs coming throughout each month. That’s a major priority for me.

## Slide Strap

I ordered the [Sage Slide strap from Peak Design](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/slide) a few days ago. It’s arriving today. I look forward to having a better strap on this camera. The one that comes with it hurts my neck and limits me as I’m trying to shoot. After doing research, this is the best one out there.

## New Logo

My photo site is now live at [nashp.photo](https://nashp.photo) (still have a lot of work to do on it, but the main focus was to get it up and running). I hired someone to design the logo, using a sketch I made for them[^1]. I like the way it came out. A simple logo that’s straight to the point.

## Church Notes

[May 15th](051522) — The enemy’s strategy: if I can cause division from the inside, they’ll destroy themselves. The tactic of the enemy is to bring division and get us off course.

## Kendrick’s Album

I made a [post](mmatbs), preparing for the album. It shows all the little details that went into the rollout. It’s [out now](https://kendricklamar.lnk.to/MrMorale) if you haven’t heard it. I’ll be reviewing the album this week. Stay tuned for that.
