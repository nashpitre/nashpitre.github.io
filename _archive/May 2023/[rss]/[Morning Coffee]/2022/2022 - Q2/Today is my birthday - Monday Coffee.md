## Thirty Six

Still love what I wrote [last year](35), and it fits with this year as well:

> What a beautiful year it’s been to get to 35. A lot of changes. New relationship. New home. New job. New dog. Completely new life. My world looks nothing like it did before last year, and I wouldn’t change that for the world. I haven’t been creating much, because I’ve been creating a family. I’ve been more private than ever, because the world is more noisy now. I’ve fought many battles throughout my life. The silence only means that I finally won.

At 36, on my birthday, I’m reflecting on three things: my wife, my daughter, and our home. What an amazing life I have. So thankful.

## The main photos page

[nashp.com/photos](photos) is the easiest and best way to see all the latest photos. It’s a new page built by Jay Ray that goes dark and showcases all the photos in one location. We spent the week building out this page as my main photo page. I love the way it came out. Let me know what you think.

## [So many photoblogs](photos)

You’ll notice this week has a lot of [photoblogs](photos). We took lots of photos. The workflow is getting more efficient. I’m learning more about the camera daily. As you look through the pictures, I hope you see the growth from the previous ones. We’re working really hard on them.

## Organizing digital stuff

- [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)
- [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app)
- [Photos.app](https://www.apple.com/ios/photos/)  

Organizing my digital information is also where my focus has been this week. Managing all the photos I’m taking, building out my task manager for all the new projects, and organizing Ulysses for managing the stories for all of this. Feel like I’ve been chipping away at this same problem for many years now, but I consider that a good problem.
