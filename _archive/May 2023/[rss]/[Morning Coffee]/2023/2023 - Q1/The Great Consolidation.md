# The Great Consolidation

### Morning Coffee 39: January 9th, 2023

###### There is no coffee today. Just protein shakes. This also isn’t in the morning. I’m writing this in the afternoon while walking a track, right before playing basketball at a local gym. Spent the morning with Rose, enjoying the neighborhood sidewalks and parks. [Let’s begin](mailto:nashp@me.com).

## Year of Depth: Update

We’re a week into the new year, and all of my [goals](https://nashp.com/010223) are still going as planned. (I started them weeks prior, early in December, so the habits have already taken shape.)

## Health & Fitness

[Calory](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1441252752) and [Happy Scale](https://apps.apple.com/app/id532430574) are the apps I’m using to track my daily diet and weight. Happy Scale’s “moving average” is the game changer. Our weight fluctuates each day, but the moving average gives me the number to focus on. The average of all those fluctuations.

### Turning down the volume

## Reeder

What was once Twitter, Substack, YouTube, Mastodon (and so many other places to keep up with), is now simply one app: [Reeder](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1529445840).

[Reeder](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1529445840) is now my main app for all news and social media feeds. Because of this, the signal to noise ratio is much better. I no longer see the commotion that comes with a current event. Reeder keeps me informed without all the extra distractions.

Reeder is built on RSS, and I’ve learned that you can get an RSS feed for almost anything on the web.

**Examples:**

- Pasting a YouTube channel link into Reeder becomes a feed

- Adding “.rss” to the end of a Mastodon profile link becomes a feed

- In Reeder, there’s a Twitter section that connects your feed to the app

The Great Consolidation is me shrinking down the web to something much more enjoyable. The internet is a very loud place, and yet I’ve taken all that noise and consolidated it into something that’s more like a library.
