###### [Good Morning](mailto:nashp@me.com). At PJ’s Coffee. Small Vanilla Cappuccino. We’ve made it to [50 newsletters](https://nashp.com/mc) in a row! Reflecting on this process: It’s such a fulfilling routine: to wake up on Monday mornings and write a letter to the world, about life and productivity. Some weeks are better than others. Some offer more depth. But I try my best to be honest and present with whatever’s been the biggest thoughts on my mind during that week. I feel like I’m really hitting my stride lately, with a clear picture and voice. Anyways, here’s to 50. Let’s begin.

#### The Box. There’s a glowing screen from the Kindle Paperwhite. I’ve been reading [Drafts No. 4](https://www.amazon.com/Draft-No-4-Writing-Process/dp/0374142742) and [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). I’ve been listening to a lot of music, as I curate [playlists](https://www.craft.do/s/1j8IoL6mGCIrku). Started playing [Tchia](https://youtu.be/dGqQbBxXtfM). As always, I turn off everything that shows up on the screen. Only Tchia and the world is visible now. Such a beautiful and fun little game. Also been watching a lot of [Joe Hickson's](https://www.youtube.com/@JoeHickson) YouTube. Very inspiring.

# It's All Projects

### This week I discuss my Field Notes, my latest playlist, and my Things 3 setup.

## Buckets and Projects

Three buckets. Three projects. That’s what you’re seeing in the photo above. The buckets stay there all the time. The projects are active and waiting to be completed. They’ll be done and gone soon, and three more projects will be in its place. Those other projects are waiting in the "Someday" section.

When the time is right, each one will move up to active, or be canceled if they’re no longer relevant. But most importantly, they’re accounted for. And because of that, each one has a place to live until the time is right.

Let me explain.

## Everything = Project

Almost everything we do on a daily basis takes more than one action to complete. That, by definition, is a project. There’s hundreds of little things that I want to do or need to do, but initially, they’re all scattered. And without the proper clarity, it’s easy to get overwhelmed with what’s waiting to get done. A random thought/task pops up, and initially it feels like it’s a problem that lives on its own, but more than likely, it’s connected to something bigger. 

If we can get to the root of what these scattered tasks are, we’ll see that they all fold into something else. And then, by thinking through what these bigger projects are, all the scattered thoughts throughout the day now have a place to live.

Make a list of what’s on your mind, and then connect them to a bigger picture. Everything is a project.

## Custom Field Notes

I’ve been really enjoying my [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) lately. It’s been with me everywhere I go:

- It’s been with me as I go on walks. That’s where I brainstormed and processed some deep thoughts.

- It’s been with me as I served in the cafe of my church yesterday. That’s where I doodled my vision for the desk we’re building for the new office. 

What you’re seeing in the image above is a lot of little decisions that make Field Notes even more perfect for me:

- The classic color Field Notes, for simplicity, and uniformity.
- Orange duct tape, for strengthening the binding (and the cool look).
- And with a little random sticker on the cover.

[Get you a set](https://fieldnotesbrand.com). Keep it in your pocket. Maybe customize the cover. Leave your phone behind. See what your mind comes up with. These moments have given me so much insight.

## Office Hours 4

I released [Office Hours 4](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/office-hours-4/pl.u-WabZljjFdBPzPW) this past Friday. Here’s the description I wrote for it:

> Volume 4 is dedicated to static and distortion. When a musician uses it the right way, there’s an exciting energy that flows through the speakers. A grungy, rebellious sound that makes your ears perk up.
>  
> I’m fascinated by all the decisions that go into curating a playlist. I’m fascinated by listening to the ending one track and hearing how it flows into the next. I’m fascinated by the blending of genres. Welcome to Office Hours. Hope you like what I’ve been up to.

Number 5 will be here this Friday. This one will be a dedication to Hip-Hop. It’ll be the last one for awhile. I’m considering [1-5 of Office Hours](https://www.craft.do/s/1j8IoL6mGCIrku) my “Season 1”, and then I’ll take a break and gather another collection of songs for another season in the future. The thinking is that, when I return, it returns once a week, for a month again, each time.

### [Space Explorer](https://www.patreon.com/nashp). I have shared my insights on becoming a better human for [50 weeks](https://www.craft.do/s/uPvD1SnSODfwSe). [Previously](https://nashp.com/032023), I had an anniversary and started preparing for a new chapter. The journey will continue until we reach our destination.
