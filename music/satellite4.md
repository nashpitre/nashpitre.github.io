## Lyrics

Fearless. Hope you hear this. I hope that whatever’s holding you back right now will disappear and you’ll begin a career with something that fulfills you. The wind is starting spiral. The mountain that was blocking your path is now gone. All that’s left is the road ahead of you. I know that you’re scared, I’m scared for you, but your legacy is there for you. Feel the momentum is pushing you forward. Clouds glowing, my body is floating. Levitating in a circular motion. A wizard with words, I’m now surging. I’m now a surgeon: open heart for you. Retractors, pealing back the layers. Don’t even feel like the same person.

I been working on myself. Not the music, but the music trails. Like a tail, like it’s cursive. You can see that I’ve been putting in the work. So observant. I’m more determined, more allergic to anything not moving me further. I’m on the verge of a breakthrough, as I pace through it. This is page 2 of your daily news. More like Pay-Per-View that you didn’t pay for. It’s all scrambled, and you can barely get a glimpse of me, but you can hear the intensity. This is meant for me. Feeling infinite. All those barriers the devil put in front of me didn’t even put a dent in me. Should’ve been done, but the hedge of protection was a fence for me. The rejuvenation is amazing. I mean look at me. Got that look in me. Got my book-bag full equipment. Ready for whatever. This is fun for me. Got my combat boots on. It’s only pair of shoes I wear. As I travel I’m prepared for war. Now I’m airborne. Coming down from the sky, fair warning. I’m the son of the sun, got the glair on me. Put your money on the table, it’s a gamble. Place your bet on me. I been gone for awhile, good morning.

When the satellite fell. In a land of no return. The heart was involved, but now there’s no concern. It’s a soldiers journey. The training has made me ambivalent to feelings, and your emotions aren’t part of the mission. If I left you behind, I apologize, but you just weren’t part of the vision that I was given.

It’s hard to be Christian in a world full of sickness. In a world full of hypocrites, I love you anyway. My best attribute is forgiveness. All you see is division. What a beautiful world that we live in, I think to myself, as I refill my prescription. Anxiety inside of me is now more like a friendship that I live with. Thousands of words have been written, just Look at the blisters. Every sentence collectively together tell a story of a person with wisdom. It’s like we’re sitting by the fire reading scriptures, as you quietly listen.

There’s a war in the distance. How did we get here? I call on higher powers to help me out, because I’m just one person trying to figure it out. How to take what I’m thinking, and make it more. From the floor plan, to the door handle: the blueprint’s laid out. This is I what I prayed about, and now it came about. It was written.

When The Satellite Fell. That title was created before the isolation. Before the quarantine. Before the social distance. Prophetic the way that the world crashed and caved in, and everyone stayed in their house, and kept to themselves. I wrote that title months before any of this, then the story wrote itself.
