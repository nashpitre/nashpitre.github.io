## Lyrics

Olivia:

> Pray and love with sincere feelings, with good works so that the world may change. 39 years down, 1 to go. Year 40, what will you bring? 

I guess this is what it’s come to. Our lifespan’s limited. Here you go, you’re losing your energy. When you realize you’re your worst enemy. Who will you run to? There’s a difference from: I need you, I want you. There’s people in your life that’ll come through—It’s a drive-by. They won’t stay long enough to matter. In your mind there’s a battle and it constantly haunts you. Stay calm through it.

Olivia:

> Will She go away? How much we have missed. We will be in lamentation. May You triumph soon, O Queen, bringing light into the darkness. I see beautiful and sad things. Reject every vice from your heart. Strive as much as possible. Only with Her help will we open our eyes. God sends you messages through men, nature, and so many things which can only help you to understand that you must.

Came a long way from where I’m at now. A boy in a black cloud, but he never backed down. In my mind there’s a packed crowd, but open my eyes and see nothing but the background. Guess I blacked out. Memories of nothing but a trap house, or a glass house. Look around and see who I am from all directions. When the satellite fell, I guess we lost connection. Friendships ending, I guess we lost respect. Then we moved on, but I stood there waiting. Maybe a glitch will fix what is breaking, and maybe you wouldn’t exit. But this is what I’m left with. Take the good with the bad, it’s all perspective.

When there trauma involved, it’s all mental health, and no matter how good life is—how many wins that you pile up, how many friends that you round up. At the end you’re just left with your vices, and all the ghosts in your devices, and who you played nice with. In the game of life, you roll the dice and hope they don’t swipe left. Attention spans last as fast as don’t blink twice. I’m trying to slow down, but my motorbike likes this. I fell down, but getting up’s where the light is. Another year, the wisdom is better here. 21 days of fasting, through magic I disappeared.

Olivia:

> Pray and love with sincere feelings, with good works so that the world may change. 39 years down, 1 to go. Year 40, what will you bring? Will She go away? How much we have missed. We will be in lamentation. May You triumph soon, O’ Queen, bringing light into the darkness. I see beautiful and sad things. Reject every vice from your heart. Strive as much as possible. Only with Her help will we open our eyes. God sends you messages through men, nature, and so many things which can only help you to understand that you must.

When the satellite fell. In a land of no return. The heart was involved, but now there’s no concern. It’s a soldiers journey. The training has made me ambivalent to feelings, and your emotions aren’t part of the mission. If I left you behind, I apologize, but you just weren’t part of the vision that I was given.

It’s hard to be Christian in a world full of sickness. In a world full of hypocrites, I love you anyway. My best attribute is forgiveness. All you see is division. What a beautiful world that we live in, I think to myself, as I refill my prescription. Anxiety inside of me is now more like a friendship that I live with. Thousands of words have been written, just Look at the blisters. Every sentence collectively together tell a story of a person with wisdom. It’s like we’re sitting by the fire reading scriptures, as you quietly listen.

There’s a war in the distance. How did we get here? I call on higher powers to help me out, because I’m just one person trying to figure it out. How to take what I’m thinking, and make it more. From the floor plan, to the door handle: the blueprint’s laid out. This is I what I prayed about, and now it came about. It was written.

When The Satellite Fell. That title was created before the isolation. Before the quarantine. Before the social distance. Prophetic the way that the world crashed and caved in, and everyone stayed in their house, and kept to themselves. I wrote that title months before any of this, then the story wrote itself.
