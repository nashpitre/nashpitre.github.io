This is the tale of two brothers. One brother somehow caught many breaks, and life simply drifted by for him. But for the other brother, nothing came easy. Life was dark and complicated. A good day for him was the ones that he couldn't remember. All of the other days—the ones that were gloomy—are broken down into these three songs.
