*I'm starting something new on my site. I'll be calling it Collections. Each Collection will consist of four shirts, all with different designs that tell a specific story.*

**The Impact Collection**

- 1 of 4 - [Randal Strong][1]
- 2 of 4 - [Hero][2]
- 3 of 4 - [Creative Minds][3]
- 4 of 4 - ?

# Randal Strong

![][image-1]

\*\*1 of 4 — [Randal Strong][4]\*\*: The first design is for my friend Randal, who's battling cancer, and time seems to be running out for him. The phrase #RandalStrong signifies a fighter, someone who continues to overcome adversity on a daily basis. All proceeds will go to him and his family.

Sizes:

- [Adults][5]
- [Kids][6]
- [Toddlers][7]

# Hero

**2 of 4 — [Hero][8]**: The second design for The Impact Collection is my own special super team: Astro Boy, BB-8, Brayden, Future Trunks, and Link. All proceeds will go to Brayden (which means new Nerf guns and Lego sets).

Sizes:

- [Adults][9]
- [Kids][10]
