> The art of living is always to make a good thing out of a bad thing. — E.F. Schumacher

To say February is the shortest month of the year is weird, because it definitely felt long to me. I read January‘s [recap][1] before writing this one, and it really feels like a lifetime ago. Bad seasons will do that to you, though. Time begins to drag, removing all momentum from your daily routine.

This is a reminder to protect yourself from the unknown forces — both internal and external. They arrive with only one mission: to remove your peace. So above all else, guard your heart. It’s all you have.

It was just one month though — and a new month is here — and as I’m writing this, I already feel 100 times better than I felt all of last month.

I was able to release two new [guest posts][2] in February. Both are timely and worth checking out:

- [Three Years Sober, By Dodi Adams][3]
- [The Tap-In (and how to setup your chances in life), by Jake Underwood][4]

My first post of February, looking back, was also timely. The sky is not the limit.
