### Footer Concept

With this engine, the footer of the site isn’t just a footer that’s seen at the bottom of a page...for what I’m building, the footer IS the website. The traditional blog structure sets you up to fail..making it only as good as your last post..forgetting about everything you’ve ever done. This engine rewards all your best work by putting it front and center, no matter how long ago it was created. This gives you the freedom to know that you’re not just chasing your tail and creating for the sake of new, but instead, to make meaningful content for your site.

Hours of intricate decisions were made to make this engine as simple and as powerful as it currently is. Every pixel, every inch, every detail, is extremely thought out. Customized and constructed to sync with the way we think blogging and creating should be displayed.
