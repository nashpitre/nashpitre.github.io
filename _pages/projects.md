## [Music][5]

This has been a very quiet year for me. Even though I released three new albums—[When The Satellite Fell][6], [Chasing My Ghost][7], and [The Illusion of Progress][8] (the most I’ve ever done in a single year)—there has been hardly any discussions or promotion for them. Most of this music was made prior to 2020. *Ghost* and *Progress* were recorded last year, then released in February and June. *Satellite* was recorded this year in March, and then released in September.

## [Photos][9]

There’s a [photoblog][10] for each month. Pictures taken with an iPhone, telling my story throughout the year.

## Morning Coffee

A weekly newsletter. It's simple: if you write your email address [here][11], my words will reach you again.

## Membership

[Choose][12] what you pay. Whatever amount you choose will help fund the website and all the things I create.
