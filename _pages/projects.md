## 2020

**[Music][1]** — This has been a very quiet year for me. Even though I released three new albums—[When The Satellite Fell][7], [Chasing My Ghost][8], and [The Illusion of Progress][9] (the most I’ve ever done in a single year)—there has been hardly any discussions or promotion for them. Most of this music was made prior to 2020. *Ghost* and *Progress* were recorded last year, then released in February and June. *Satellite* was recorded this year in March, and then released in September.

**[Photos][2]** — There’s a photoblog for each month. Pictures taken with an iPhone, telling my story throughout the year.

**[Videos][3]** — A [basketball][basketball] video, three videos that captured our roadtrip to the Grand Canyon ([one][c1], [two][c2], [three][c3]), and another video that captured a roadtrip to [pick up my dad][dad] after seven years.

**[Books][4]** — I released a poetry book titled [For My Brother][brother] that captured many stories, from a dream, to a testimony, messages from others, to all the lyrics from the four songs that made the album.
