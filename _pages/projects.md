## [Music][5]

This has been a very quiet year for me. Even though I released three new albums—[When The Satellite Fell][6], [Chasing My Ghost][7], and [The Illusion of Progress][8] (the most I’ve ever done in a single year)—there has been hardly any discussions or promotion for them. Most of this music was made prior to 2020. *Ghost* and *Progress* were recorded last year, then released in February and June. *Satellite* was recorded this year in March, and then released in September.

## [Photos][9]

There’s a photoblog for each month. Pictures taken with an iPhone, telling my story throughout the year.

## [Morning Coffee][10]

A weekly newsletter. It's simple: if you write your email address here, my words will reach you again.

## [Membership][11]

Choose what you pay. Whatever amount you choose will help fund the website and all the things I create.
