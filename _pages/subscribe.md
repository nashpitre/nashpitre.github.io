## Newsletter

It's simple: if you write your email address here, my words will reach you again.

<!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form -->

## Membership

This is my **Choose what you pay** box. It allows you to subscribe monthly, helping the site raise money and remain succesful. This is a huge upgrade to the previous way memberships were handled: it’s no longer a set price that you have to follow. Now, if you’d like to contribute $20 a month...or just $1, that choice is completely yours. Whatever fits your budget and the amount you think I deserve. I continue to focus on making this site my full-time job, and this new feature is aligned with that goal in mind. I always say not to become a member or support this site unless you feel like I’m bringing in enough value for you to do so. I want to earn your support.

<form class="contribute" action="https://nashp.memberful.com/checkout" method="get">
  <input type="hidden" name="plan" value="53002" />
  <input type="number" name="price" placeholder="Choose what you pay" required="required" min="1.00" step="0.01" />
  <input type="submit" value="Contribute now" />
</form>

### More details

You can look at the [events](create) I hosted that held over 50 people on a given night (look at all those kids that showed up to the “Teach Me How To Doodle” event), or the [discography](music) that spans back almost 20 years (since 2003, with over 25 albums), or all the [guest](guest) posts from other people sharing their personal stories (26 and counting so far), or the vlogs ([Grand Canyon Road Trip](canyon)), essays ([Us](us)), books ([For My Brother](a1)), shirts ([Be The Light](light)), [music videos](https://nashp.com/music#videos), and *all* the other random things my brain comes up with throughout the year. All of these things together tell a singular story. It’s simple: **I create things**.

I definitely believe the value is already here for you to contribute, but that’s enough about all the things I’ve *already* created. I don’t want to look back at my past accomplishments—that’s when complacency creeps in. I’d rather focus on what’s to come (Like new albums and new distribution channels for those albums, new essays, vlogs, and more ways for you to get involved with telling your own story).

I’m confident in the work I continue to put in, and your contribution is what keeps this site alive and thriving. I appreciate all current members, and I look forward to all the new members that this update will bring in. Either way, thanks for sticking around as I build cool things.
