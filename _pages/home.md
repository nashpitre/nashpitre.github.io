Being a dad to a three-year-old girl that loves reading books and playing cozy farm video games. Preparing for twin boys in the fall. Doing tech support for our local hospital. Running, lifting, and playing basketball throughout the week. Enjoying silence as much as possible. Slowly working on three big writing projects.
