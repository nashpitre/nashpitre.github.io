Listening to IGOR right now. Inspired by all the the layers that I'm hearing. I'll be writing to this all weekend.

---- 

I had a meeting with someone yesterday about building them a website. I'll be building a lot of websites soon, for a lot of people. We’ll call it The Engine Project for now. Let me know if you're interested.

---- 

I had a conversation yesterday with a friend, just helping them through a tough situation...and that’s been happening a lot lately. Many people around me are currently dealing with something heavy. I wish I could remove all that weight from each of you. You’re on my heart this morning.

---- 

I'll be out of town for the next two weeks. On an adventure in Texas. See you when I get back.
