The app started on iOS and iPadOS, then later added support for visionOS. With today’s update, Longplay is available on macOS, too, where it adds unique automation features.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIf you aren’t familiar with Longplay, be sure to check out my reviews of version 2.0 for iOS and iPadOS and the app’s debut on the Vision Pro. I love the app’s album art-forward design, collection and queuing systems for navigating and organizing large music libraries, and many other ways to sort, filter, and rediscover your favorite albums. Here’s how Adrian describes Longplay in a post introducing the Mac version:⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt filters out the albums where you only have a handful of tracks, and focusses on those complete or nearly complete albums in your library instead. It analyses your album stats to help you rediscover forgotten favourites and explore your library in different ways. You can organise your albums into collections, including smart ones. And you can go deep with automation support.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWith the introduction of Longplay for Mac, the app is now available everywhere, with feature parity across all versions. Plus, Longplay syncs across all devices, so your Collections and Smart Collections are available on every platform.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe other big deal about Longplay for the Mac is its deep integration with automation tools. The app features the same extensive support for Shortcuts on Mac as it does elsewhere, with over two dozen available actions. It supports AppleScript, too, which is what drives an Alfred workflow that is linked in Longplay’s settings. Longplay also integrates with Last.fm and ListenBrainz for tracking what you listen to.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nClaude compiling a Longplay Collection based on a comparison of my Apple Music library to the list it created for me previously.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nHowever, the most interesting of all of Longplay’s automation integrations is its built-in MCP server. MCP is a protocol that allows AI chatbots like Claude to interact with apps. With Longplay’s MCP server, you can do things like create Collections and Smart Collections and queue albums for playback from inside a chatbot. What makes the integration so powerful is the ability to perform those actions with the sort of natural language requests that are the bread and butter of chatbots.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFor example, the other day I asked Claude Sonnet 4 to compile a list of the top 100 alternative and indie albums of the ’80s. After consulting several sources, Claude generated a list, which I then asked it to use to create a Longplay Collection using my Apple Music library. Claude got to work and created my Collection after comparing its list with my Apple Music library for a couple of minutes.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLongplay is the first app I’ve tried that uses a built-in MCP server, and I’m sold. The combination of a chatbot’s research strength and Longplay’s actions makes its MCP integration a compelling way to explore your music.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nI had fewer of the albums on Claude’s list than I expected, which is something I’ll have to correct manually given MusicKit limitations.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nOne downside of controlling Apple Music with an MCP server – which I want to emphasize is not a Longplay limitation – is that it can only create Longplay Collections from the albums in your library. You might expect that the MCP integration would allow Longplay to add all 100 of the albums in the Top 100 list to my library, but it can’t because MusicKit doesn’t offer that functionality. It’s a shortcoming of Apple’s that has held back automation in other areas like Shortcuts ever since the debut of Apple Music a decade ago.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nApple’s API limitations aside, Longplay is one of the most automatable music apps I’ve tried. Add to that its beautiful design and thoughtful discovery features, and what you get is one of the premier music apps on any of Apple’s platforms. It’s made all the better by the addition of the Mac app, which nicely rounds out Longplay’s lineup.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLongplay for Mac is available as a standalone purchase from the Mac App Store for $24.99 and directly from the Longplay website.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAccess Extra Content and Perks⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFounded in 2015, Club MacStories has delivered exclusive content every week for nearly a decade.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWhat started with weekly and monthly email newsletters has blossomed into a family of memberships designed every MacStories fan.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nClub MacStories: Weekly and monthly newsletters via email and the web that are brimming with apps, tips, automation workflows, longform writing, early access to the MacStories Unwind podcast, periodic giveaways, and more;⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nClub MacStories+: Everything that Club MacStories offers, plus an active Discord community, advanced search and custom RSS features for exploring the Club’s entire back catalog, bonus columns, and dozens of app discounts;⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nClub Premier: All of the above and AppStories+, an extended version of our flagship podcast that’s delivered early, ad-free, and in high-bitrate audio.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLearn more here and from our Club FAQs.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nJoin Now","id":"[macstories.net\/feed]https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/?p=78971","content_html":"<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.macstories.net\/cleanshot-2025-07-15-at-09-21-57-2x-1752585763592.png\" alt=\"\" \/><p class=\"image-caption\"><\/p><\/div>\n<p id=\"p2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/longplay-album-player\/id1599401757\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Longplay<\/a> by Adrian Sch&ouml;nig is an excellent album-oriented music app that integrates with Apple Music.

Additionally, there have been new series just as worthy of our time, whether it was a razor-sharp Hollywood satire or an anxiety-inducing medical drama. For all that and more, check out The Ringer’s best shows of 2025 so far.  ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n10. The White Lotus ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe third season of the HBO anthology series The White Lotus had its fair share of detractors who found fault with its languid pacing and trigger-happy finale. To which I say: Even a lesser season of Mike White’s opus is better than damn near everything else on television. As The White Lotus moves to Thailand, all the familiar ingredients remain in place: über-wealthy guests trying to throw money at all their problems, an incident on hotel grounds that leads to a body count, hapless workers sometimes literally getting caught in the crossfire. Striking a balance between provocative and profound—best encapsulated by Sam Rockwell’s god-tier monologue in the fifth episode—The White Lotus uses its Eastern setting to explore a very Western kind of spiritual malaise, and how clinging to a fixed identity leads to more suffering. Once again, the show’s A-list ensemble delivers the goods, and some up-and-comers announce themselves in the mainstream. (Sam Nivola, Sarah Catherine Hook, Patrick Schwarzenegger … we will watch your careers with great interest.) Was Season 3 a perfect stay at The White Lotus? Perhaps not, but it was still a rich experience in more ways than one. —Miles Surrey ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n9. Common Side Effects⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLate last year, animation maven Joe Bennett confirmed that the criminally underseen Scavengers Reign, one of our favorite shows of 2023, would not be receiving a Season 2. Sadness ensued. But a few months later, so did a spiritual sequel: Common Side Effects, which, like Scavengers Reign, was cocreated by Bennett and animated by the company he cofounded, Green Street Pictures. The new sci-fi series, which aired on Adult Swim and streamed on Max, takes place on our planet, but it’s just as trippy as its interplanetary predecessor. The series revolves around Marshall Cuso, a well-intentioned, antiestablishment loner who’s trying to cultivate a kind of mushroom that can heal any illness or wound—or even, under some circumstances, bring people back from the dead. Nefarious forces scheme to stop him from destabilizing the status quo, which may be for the best: However righteous Cuso’s cause, his cure-all could have unintended, disastrous consequences. Common Side Effects is equal parts utopian and poignant, sentimental and cynical, playful and profound. It’s almost as if one of Marshall’s miraculous mushrooms resurrected Scavengers Reign—but this time, the series secured a second season. —Ben Lindbergh⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n8. Paradise⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAn unexpected hit, Paradise came out of nowhere, slinging twists, turns, and the occasional (and equally unexpected) perfect hour of television, all centered around two of the best on-screen performers Hollywood’s got. Seriously, did anyone know that James Marsden was about to play the president of the United States, with Sterling K. Brown as his head of Secret Service (with a few secrets of his own, of course), before Paradise dropped on Hulu? With those kinds of acting chops, this frothy political thriller didn’t need to take itself too seriously. Paradise’s twists are a little campy, and its side characters are a little one-note at times, but its concept is sturdy, and its narrative efficiency makes getting on board this dystopian ride as easy as paying for a drink with the mysterious bracelets we find everyone wearing in the pilot. Plus, the actors at its center are mesmerizing together (and not just because of their handsome faces—but also not in spite of them!). And then comes Episode 7. After easing us into the steady cadence of a juicy mystery, series creator Dan Fogelman gives us an end-of-the-world hour so visceral, so action-packed, so emotionally compelling that a more fainthearted writer would have stretched it into an entire series. In its tight eight-episode run, Paradise manages much more than just the end of the world. —Jodi Walker⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n7. Dept. Q⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBritish detective mystery series aren’t exactly uncommon. They can often be a bit formulaic, and therefore predictable, yet there can be something comforting about them for that reason—even when the subject matter isn’t. But every now and then, a new series comes along to subvert that formula and remind us why this TV genre is so popular in the first place.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBased on Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen’s crime novel series and developed for TV by Scott Frank (The Queen’s Gambit) and Chandni Lakhani (Vigil), Dept. Q follows ace detective Carl Morck (Matthew Goode) as he leads a new police department that investigates cold cases. This is, of course, all while the sardonic cop tries to deal with nearly dying in a shooting that begins the series. The nine-episode season is sleekly shot and cleverly told, with a gripping story and quirky ensemble that both only get better as the drama grows. Dept. Q manages to draw you in from the opening episode with a clever closing twist, making it perfect for your next binge watch on Netflix. —Daniel Chin⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n6. Severance ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBetter late than never: After almost three years off the air, Apple TV+’s Severance finally returned for its second season. That’s a long layoff for any series to endure—let alone a mystery-box thriller—but Severance didn’t skip a beat. (Same goes for the marching band.) After introducing viewers to employees who elected to be “severed”—splitting their consciousness between their lives at the office (innies) and at home (outies)—Season 2 delves deeper into the inner workings of the mysterious Lumon Industries and what, exactly, the company stands to gain from creating this procedure. Meanwhile, our protagonist Mark (Adam Scott) pushes ahead with the potentially dangerous process of reintegrating his outie and innie selves. Episodes centered on a bizarro corporate retreat and the backstory of Mark’s wife, Gemma (Dichen Lachman), who has no recollection of her life outside of Lumon, are particular standouts, but on the whole, Severance gets top marks for its production design, performances, and world-building. As we look ahead to Season 3, Severance remains mysterious and important television. —Surrey⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n5. The Studio⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAs someone who writes about pop culture for a living, Apple TV+’s glitzy industry satire, The Studio, was always going to be an easy sell. Following Matt Remick (cocreator Seth Rogen), the newly installed head of the fictional Continental Studios, the series touches on issues near and dear to Hollywood: studios single-mindedly fixating on IP, artificial intelligence taking work away from artists, executives not being thanked by talent during acceptance speeches (unless you’re Ted Sarandos). Combining Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s cringe comedy with the long, unbroken takes associated with prestige films like Birdman, The Studio holds real affection for the art of moviemaking even as it intimates, with every hilarious misstep by the characters, that we’re looking at an industry in crisis. (Case in point: Matt trying—and failing—to turn Martin Scorsese’s Jim Jones biopic into a Kool-Aid movie.) That a sardonic love letter to cinema happens to be financed by a tech company is the ultimate punch line. —Surrey ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n4. Adolescence⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe story of a 13-year-old boy who’s accused of murder—and the family that’s forced to reckon with where he, and they, went wrong—Adolescence is hard to watch, and just as hard to stop watching. It was hard to make, too: Each hour-ish installment of the four-episode miniseries was filmed in one continuous shot, a cinematographic feat rivaled by the prowess on display in front of the camera. (I can’t imagine summoning so much sincere-seeming emotion while hitting so many marks during each of the 10-plus takes per episode.) Few works of fiction present their protagonist as so sympathetic and so scary, depending on the episode and scene. Of course, this work was heavily informed by actual events, which could have made the series land like an afterschool-special-style stunt in less skilled hands. Adolescence made me happy to have grown up before smartphones, social media, and the “manosphere,” and afraid for those who have to navigate the dystopian pitfalls of modern-day youth. Not that coming of age at any age is easy. —Lindbergh⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n3. The Pitt⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIf it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. The medical melodrama led by a coterie of grizzled oldsters and shiny-eyed rookies was never broken … and The Pitt didn’t aim to fix it. Creator R. Scott Gemmill and executive producer (and star!) Noah Wyle simply took a defibrillator to the heart of what people still long for in their television shows: a balanced diet of episodic and serialized storytelling, released at a weekly clip, in a long enough season to draw in viewers and build word-of-mouth enthusiasm. The show is livened up by its real-time “live from the emergency room, it’s the most stressful 15-hour shift of your life” episode structure, propelled forward by harrowing and occasionally comedic medical crises, and anchored by lived-in performances from—actually, I won’t even attempt to choose a handful of actors to spotlight; they’re all great. The very best part of The Pitt was meeting its dynamic cast, filled out almost exclusively with names you’ve never heard of and with faces you won’t soon forget, because (a) they’re gorgeous, and (b) they’re about to be everywhere. Sound familiar? Audiences arrived in the TV emergency room with streaming fatigue and a stomachache from Netflix bloat and left (after several hours in the waiting room) with an HBO prescription in hand for Season 2, which will hit our screens exactly a year after Season 1 premiered. It’s good to be Pitt-pilled. —Walker⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n2. The Rehearsal⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt’s no easy task encapsulating The Rehearsal within the span of a couple hundred words—or any number of words, really. Nathan Fielder’s HBO series is part comedy, part reality TV, and part performance art, all wrapped up in one deeply uncomfortable yet mesmerizing viewing experience. And with the Canadian comedian (and licensed commercial pilot) using Season 2 to focus on an investigation into the urgent topic of aviation accidents, Fielder takes The Rehearsal to absurd new heights.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFielder goes to extraordinary lengths to test his theory that most fatal airplane crashes that you’ll too often read about in the news occurred as a result of poor communication between pilots in the cockpit. Across six episodes, his research leads him to everything from using actual pilots as the judges of a fake singing competition (that the contestants believe is real) to recreating the childhood of Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger to Fielder piloting a full flight in a Boeing 737 himself. There’s always a tinge of uncertainty over whether what’s unfolding onscreen could actually be real—and that’s part of the indelible beauty of this gloriously bizarre and ethically murky series. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt’s hard to say whether there’ll ever again be anything on TV quite like The Rehearsal’s second season. But maybe that’s just because the series hasn’t been renewed—at least not yet. —Chin⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n1. Andor⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAndor’s audience didn’t grow in its second season—which means way too many TV viewers missed the leader in the clubhouse for the best show of the year. Even if the Nielsen numbers were no bigger, the budget and the expectations were. But Andor’s creative direction didn’t disappoint. The series served its ensemble of war-weary characters, delivered a perceptive and inspiring commentary on current events, and seamlessly segued into the preestablished Star Wars timeline—sending fans flocking to Rogue One and Battlefront II for a post-finale fix. There may be a yearlong live-action lull between the end of Andor and the premiere of The Mandalorian & Grogu, which is fortunate for Lucasfilm: I wouldn’t want to be the one who has to follow up the finest Star Wars since the original film series—if not the new artistic standard for the franchise.

Sadness ensued. But a few months later, so did a spiritual sequel: <em>Common Side Effects<\/em>, which, like <em>Scavengers Reign<\/em>, was cocreated by Bennett and animated by the company he cofounded, Green Street Pictures. The new sci-fi series, which aired on Adult Swim and streamed on Max, takes place on our planet, but it’s just as trippy as its interplanetary predecessor. The series revolves around Marshall Cuso, a well-intentioned, antiestablishment loner who’s trying to cultivate a kind of mushroom that can heal any illness or wound—or even, under some circumstances, bring people back from the dead. Nefarious forces scheme to stop him from destabilizing the status quo, which may be for the best: However righteous Cuso’s cause, his cure-all could have unintended, disastrous consequences. <em>Common Side Effects<\/em> is equal parts utopian and poignant, sentimental and cynical, playful and profound.

The film boasts an excellent leading trio in David Corenswet as Superman, Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, and Nicholas Hoult as the villainous Lex Luthor; each actor perfectly encapsulates their iconic characters while still making them their own. And above all else, Superman is simply a fun superhero movie that provides the kind of sincere, hopeful message that the Man of Steel has always been built on. It captures the fantastic spirit of the comic books and showcases the DCU’s potential.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThat said, Superman is far from perfect. The film struggles to balance its self-contained narrative with its need to establish the wider DCU, as an influx of complementary superheroes jockey for screen time with Superman and his friends and family. The story overextends itself with too many moving parts: the introductions of all of these characters, a geopolitical conflict that reflects real-world issues in simplistic terms, the existence of pocket dimensions, and an exploration of what it means to be human. Superman hits the ground running and hardly ever slows down long enough to let its strengths breathe.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe DCEU’s demise placed significant pressure on Superman to win back audiences who might be skeptical of the DC brand, and to lay a foundation for the DCU. Even with the film’s flaws, Gunn’s latest superhero project should be considered a success in those regards. Because this movie is much more than Corenswet’s introduction as the new Man of Steel; it’s a promising beginning to DC Studios’ sprawling 10-year plan.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAfter Superman’s long-awaited return to theaters, here are my main takeaways about how the film affects the DCU’s direction.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nA New Superman … and Supergirl⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAt the start of Superman, text explains that Kal-El landed on Earth 30 years ago and announced himself to the world as Superman three years ago. That allows Gunn to skip the widely known origin story of the 87-year-old character. This is probably the right narrative decision, even if it means sacrificing some of this particular Superman’s development.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSuperman excels at demonstrating the Man of Steel’s unwavering commitment to protecting every living being—from humans to squirrels. That devotion to preserving all life is Superman’s greatest strength, and also his fatal flaw, as it sometimes leads him to lose sight of the bigger picture. This is one of the most compelling themes that the film explores: Superman jeopardizes the safety of Metropolis so he can safely decommission a monstrous kaiju, and he prevents Boravia’s invasion of Jarhanpur, which raises intriguing ethical questions about superhero interventionism. The fact that Superman has constructed his life around protecting others makes it all the more jarring when Luthor unearths the damaged portion of a once-cherished message that Kal-El’s Kryptonian parents left him, revealing their desire for him to use his heightened abilities to rule over the planet and repopulate the Kryptonian race by any means necessary.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt’s a shame, then, that this core tension gets a little lost in the overall clutter of the movie, with Superman’s evolution ultimately deprioritized in his own story. There’s one powerful scene between Clark and Jonathan Kent (Pruitt Taylor Vince) in which Clark’s adoptive father tells his son that he doesn’t have to become the man that his biological parents wanted him to be. However, this moment is the one significant on-screen interaction that Clark has with either Pa or Martha Kent (Neva Howell). By the end of Superman, Clark no longer listens to that formative message from Krypton as a means of soothing himself. He embraces his humanity over his Kryptonian heritage and opts to look at images of his adoptive parents from Smallville instead. Clark seems to be trying to forget about Jor-El and Lara altogether, but the film sidesteps a more pronounced and meaningful resolution to its massive change to the Superman lore.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt’s an admirably bold choice by Gunn to alter the traditionally noble intentions that Kal-El’s parents have had for sending the last son of Krypton to Earth. But the underdevelopment of that crucial plot point—a foundational element of the character—is a symptom of the filmmaker’s tendency to stuff his movies with too many ideas.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFor better or for worse, Superman is just an introduction to the Man of Steel and the wider DCU, so the window to assess the implications of Jor-El’s Viltrumite motivations is far from closed. And the story of Krypton—if not Kal-El’s parents—will be explored through the lens of another superhero who’s introduced in the final moments of the film: Supergirl (Milly Alcock).⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAlcock’s debut functions like a customary big-screen stinger, even more so than the pair of scenes that appear during and after the credits. Kal-El’s cousin crashes into the Fortress of Solitude as she returns from an apparent off-world bender, and Superman tells one of his automatons that she likes to party on planets with red suns so she can feel the effects of alcohol. (Kryptonians can’t get drunk on Earth due to the immense power that they draw from the planet’s yellow sun.) Kara is there to pick up her dog, Krypto—and that he’s her dog explains the super canine’s unruly behavior, as it never made much sense that the ever-responsible Clark would’ve done such a pitiful job training him.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAlthough Kara’s appearance is brief, the scene quickly establishes the stark difference between the two Kryptonians, and the interplanetary interests that Supergirl is set to explore. The upcoming movie, directed by Craig Gillespie (I, Tonya) and written by Ana Nogueira, is slated for release on June 26, 2026. Supergirl is based on the critically acclaimed comic book miniseries written by Tom King, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. Here’s the premise of the film, according to a report from Variety in early 2024: “In the new iteration, Supergirl travels across the galaxy to celebrate her 21st birthday with Krypto the Superdog. Along the way, she meets a young woman named Ruthye and winds up on a murderous quest for revenge.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBy introducing Kara and Krypto in Superman, Gunn has already laid some of the groundwork for next summer’s blockbuster as the DCU pushes forward.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe Justice Gang and a Universe of Metahumans⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAlong with all the information about Superman’s origins, the opening text of the film also reveals a crucial bit of world-building: The first metahumans were discovered on Earth 300 years ago.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThat’s a pretty massive revelation that raises all sorts of questions about the ripple effects metahumans have had on human civilization over three centuries. In the present-day context of Superman, Luthor uses his own metahumans to lead Planet Watch, a task force that Luthor controls, which he offers to the American government as a response to Superman. And then there’s also the so-called Justice Gang, a trio of superheroes—Green Lantern\/Guy Gardner (Nathan Fillion), Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), and Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi)—that often teams up with Superman, even though their morals are more questionable than those of the Big Blue Boy Scout.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWhile Gardner and Hawkgirl play bit parts in Superman, Mister Terrific has a substantial role in the film as he teams up with Lois to try to save Superman after he’s taken to Luthor’s pocket dimension. It’s there that the Man of Steel also meets Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan), another metahuman who’s being held captive (along with his son) by Luthor. Metamorpho has the ability to transmute his body into other elements, including kryptonite, which Luthor takes full advantage of. Whether with The Guardians of the Galaxy franchise or The Suicide Squad, Gunn has always loved to take lesser-known and\/or oddball characters and put them in the spotlight. In Superman, the filmmaker chooses Metamorpho and Mister Terrific to satisfy that itch, and as a result, these two superheroes account for some of the movie’s standout moments.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWhat with Superman, the Justice Gang (which includes Metamorpho by the end of the film), Planet Watch, Luthor, the Daily Planet staff, both sets of Clark’s parents, and Krypto, there isn’t nearly enough screen time for every character to play a meaningful or satisfying role across the 129-minute film. Even still, many of them get at least one moment to shine, or otherwise leave the viewer wanting to see more of them. Although this large cast comes at a cost to Superman’s story (and the portrayal of Superman himself), the boundless imagination—and absurd wealth of characters—provided by the back catalog of DC Comics is on full display.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSuperman neatly wraps up its story with Clark and Mister Terrific preventing Metropolis from collapsing into a black hole, Luthor being sent to Belle Reve for his crimes, and the Justice Gang being celebrated for their heroism after protecting Jarhanpur from Boravia during another attempted invasion. But the end of the film also sets up the DCU’s future, particularly where metahumans are concerned. In a conversation between the secretary of defense, General Mori (James Hiroyuki Liao), and General Rick Flag Sr. (Frank Grillo), Mori warns Flag that the metahumans are the ones making the rules now. Although Gardner claimed to have no interest in interfering with global politics earlier in the movie, he and his team end up doing exactly what Superman did, and even going one drastic step further in killing the Boravian president. And the Justice Gang does all of this without consulting the American government, which had previously allied with Boravia.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWith Superman regaining the favor of the public, and Metamorpho joining a revamped Justice Gang that’s now unafraid to impose their will, regardless of any legal constraints, the metahumans’ influence is rapidly growing—and even humans with less severe grudges than Luthor are concerned. Flag, the father of Colonel Rick Flag Jr. from Gunn’s The Suicide Squad, is limited to a small role in Superman, but Grillo reprises his character from Creature Commandos. While that connection doesn’t amount to much within the scope of this film, Flag is also set to return in the second season of Peacemaker, which will likely continue to pull on this narrative thread as a conflict emerges between humans and metahumans in the DCU.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe New DCU⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSuperman is a wildly different take on the eponymous storied superhero than Man of Steel. Part of that disparity stems from the filmmaking sensibilities of the respective directors: Snyder favors a darker, grittier tone, while Gunn leans into a brighter, more earnest interpretation of the character (with a heavy dose of humor and needle drops). The malleability of Superman himself is responsible for some of the divide, too. But the most substantial reason for the new movie’s departure from its predecessor’s tone is that this time, DC Studios has a larger plan that doesn’t hinge on catching up to Marvel Studios as quickly as possible.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSuperman might be weighed down by its obligations to the DCU in a way that Man of Steel wasn’t, but it’s easy to see how future DCU projects might benefit from the work that Superman has already put in. The second season of Peacemaker is coming next month, and teasers have already shown that Hawkgirl, Guy Gardner, and Maxwell Lord (Sean Gunn)—the last of whom appears in a very brief cameo in the film—will return in some capacity. (It’s possible that their roles will be as small as Peacemaker’s was in Superman; John Cena briefly reprised the role for a gag as a guest on a talk show.) And the aforementioned Flag is expected to play a more substantial part, now that the general has been named as the new director of government agency A.R.G.U.S. following Amanda Waller’s dismissal in Season 1, as Peacemaker builds on a plot point from The Suicide Squad that featured Christopher Smith killing Flag’s son.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAdditionally, the upcoming HBO Max series Lanterns will piggyback on Gardner’s debut and likely provide a more meaningful (and serious) introduction to the Green Lantern Corps, more than 14 years after the disastrous Green Lantern film that starred Ryan Reynolds. The TV show will be the first taste of a DCU project that doesn’t have Gunn’s creative imprint all over it; showrunner Chris Mundy (Ozark, True Detective) will lead the eight-episode season that will premiere in early 2026. The series will introduce Green Lanterns Hal Jordan (Kyle Chandler) and John Stewart (Aaron Pierre), and will feature a returning Gardner, who’ll apparently be “a little bit higher strung” in an undoubtedly different narrative environment.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWith Lanterns, Supergirl, and the Mike Flanagan–penned Clayface film set to follow the Gunn trio of Creature Commandos, Superman, and Peacemaker, we’ll see next year how well these disparate DCU projects will fit together. More than that, we’ll find out whether Gunn and DC Studios co-head Peter Safran will afford other filmmakers the creative freedom they promised they would upon the formation of DC Studios.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFor now, DC Studios can enjoy the fresh start that Superman has helped deliver. Although David Zaslav’s recent history doesn’t inspire much confidence when it comes to brand stability, the Warner Bros. Discovery CEO proudly voiced his support of Gunn and the new direction of the studio to the media at the conclusion of this crucial opening weekend. “Superman is just the first step,” Zaslav said, adding, “The DC vision is clear, the momentum is real, and I couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead.”","id":"[wp.theringer.com\/feed\/]https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/?p=720203","content_html":"\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"233\" src=\"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-356687\" srcset=\"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-300x27.jpg 300w, https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-1024x93.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-768x70.jpg 768w, https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-1536x140.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-2048x186.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Though James Gunn quietly opened the new DC Universe with the animated series <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2024\/12\/05\/dc\/creature-commandos-review-james-gunn-dc-universe-dcu\"><em>Creature Commandos<\/em><\/a> last December, the fledgling cinematic franchise took off in earnest when <em>Superman<\/em> arrived in theaters last week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little more than 10 years after Zack Snyder’s <em>Man of Steel<\/em> kicked off DC’s first attempt at a rival to the MCU, the DC Extended Universe, Gunn has turned to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2025\/07\/09\/dc\/superman-history-dc-reboot-james-gunn-snyderverse-smallville\">company’s foundational superhero<\/a> to lead DC into another new era—one that the DC Studios executive surely hopes will be more fruitful than its predecessor.

And the aforementioned Flag is expected to play a more substantial part, now that the general has been named as the new director of government agency A.R.G.U.S. following Amanda Waller’s dismissal in Season 1, as <em>Peacemaker<\/em> builds on a plot point from <em>The Suicide Squad <\/em>that featured Christopher Smith killing Flag’s son.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the upcoming HBO Max series <em>Lanterns<\/em> will piggyback on Gardner’s debut and likely provide a more meaningful (and serious) introduction to the Green Lantern Corps, more than 14 years after the disastrous <em>Green Lantern<\/em> film that starred Ryan Reynolds. The TV show will be the first taste of a DCU project that doesn’t have Gunn’s creative imprint all over it; showrunner Chris Mundy (<em>Ozark<\/em>, <em>True Detective<\/em>) will lead the eight-episode season that will premiere in early 2026. The series will introduce Green Lanterns Hal Jordan (Kyle Chandler) and John Stewart (Aaron Pierre), and will feature a returning Gardner, who’ll apparently be “<a href=\"https:\/\/ew.com\/nathan-fillion-hbo-lanterns-guy-gardner-preview-exclusive-11749359\">a little bit higher strung<\/a>” in an undoubtedly different narrative environment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-ringer-blocks-advertisement\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>With <em>Lanterns<\/em>, <em>Supergirl<\/em>, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2024\/film\/news\/clayface-movie-dc-studios-mike-flanagan-1236246625\/\">Mike Flanagan–penned <em>Clayface<\/em><\/a> film set to follow the Gunn trio of <em>Creature Commandos<\/em>, <em>Superman<\/em>,<em> <\/em>and <em>Peacemaker<\/em>, we’ll see next year how well these disparate DCU projects will fit together. More than that, we’ll find out whether Gunn and DC Studios co-head Peter Safran will afford other filmmakers the creative freedom they <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2023\/02\/01\/dc\/james-gunn-peter-safran-dc-studios-dcu-chapter-1-gods-and-monsters-explained\">promised<\/a> they would upon the formation of DC Studios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, DC Studios can enjoy the fresh start that <em>Superman <\/em>has helped deliver.

Discovery CEO <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2025\/film\/box-office\/superman-box-office-david-zaslav-dc-universe-1236459177\/\">proudly voiced<\/a> his support of Gunn and the new direction of the studio to the media at the conclusion of this crucial opening weekend. “<em>Superman<\/em> is just the first step,” Zaslav said, adding, “The DC vision is clear, the momentum is real, and I couldn’t be more excited for what’s ahead.”<\/p>","image":"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-scaled.jpg","attachments":[{"url":"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-scaled.jpg","title":"","mime_type":"image\/jpg"}],"date_published":"2025-07-14T14:57:55Z","url":"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2025\/07\/14\/dc\/how-superman-sets-up-the-dcu","_reeder":{"published":774197875,"media":[{"type":"image","text":"","url":"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/01\/spoiler-warning-v2.2-scaled.jpg"}],"id":"[wp.theringer.com\/feed\/]https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/?p=720203","feed":{"type":"rss","id":"wp.theringer.com\/feed","url":"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/feed\/","subtype":"xml","title":"The Ringer","link":"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com"},"date":774209486,"authors":[{"name":"Jack McCluskey"}]},"authors":[{"name":"The Ringer","url":"https:\/\/wp.theringer.com"}],"title":"How ‘Superman’ Sets Up the DCU"},{"content_text":"Apple's upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models may have a new copper-like orange color option, according to Sonny Dickson.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\niPhone 17 Pro in blue and orange (concept)⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIn a social media post today, Dickson shared images of alleged lens covers for the rear cameras on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, with the following five color labels: black, gray, silver, dark blue, and orange.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe black, gray, and silver colors likely correspond with the existing Black Titanium, Natural Titanium, and White Titanium finishes for the iPhone 16 Pro models, while the presence of a dark blue lens cover suggests that Apple might reintroduce the Blue Titanium color option that it offered for the iPhone 15 Pro models.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe orange lens cover is the most notable one, as it could point to an all-new copper color that Apple has never offered for any iPhone models before.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\niPhone 17 lens protection cover will match the phone color.

Released in the wake of The Dark Knight and with Iron Man ascendant, Gunn’s film riffed on nascent superhero mania by mapping the fine line between genuine righteousness and ambient, all-American rage. “You don’t butt in line!” stammers the shabbily attired Crimson Bolt (Rainn Wilson) as he stares down the petty criminal who he imagines to be his arch enemy. “You don’t sell drugs! You don’t molest little children! You don’t profit off the misery of others! The rules were set a long time ago! They don’t change.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFifteen years later, Gunn is no longer in the indie-movie trenches. Instead, he parlayed his post-Tarantino instinct for recycled pop standards—exemplified by the oh-so-’70s needle drops in Guardians of the Galaxy—into an exalted status as a comic-book-movie specialist. No less than his fellow DC-Marvel switch-hitter Joss Whedon, Gunn’s work exemplifies a cultural trajectory defined by the revenge of the nerds, but he’s more apt to cultivate ugliness. Hence the paradox of his new “soft” reboot of Superman, which finds a filmmaker defined, at his best and worst, by glibness dealing with a character whose legacy is sincerity itself.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIn interviews, Gunn has done his best to show he isn’t losing his edge, but his anti-establishment swagger is hard to square with a $225 million budget and a mandate—from noted cinephile David Zaslav—to give DC Studios’ flagship property “a coherent and creative brand strategy.” Gunn wants to have his franchise and subvert it, too. “I don’t need to see Baby Kal coming from Krypton in a little baby rocket,” he snarled in an interview with The New York Times. “We have watched a million movies with characters who don’t have their upbringing explained … who cares?”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSo what do we need to see in a Superman movie in 2025? Gunn’s answers include, but are not limited to: Lois Lane uploading a story into the Daily Planet’s CMS; Jimmy Olsen cruising through the red-light district in search of a recurring hookup listed in his phone as “Mutant Toes;” a frenetic chase scene through vomit-colored CGI that resembles Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road; Nathan Fillion in an Anton Chigurh haircut; a potentially important supporting character reduced to a drunken sorority girl; and a million monkeys at a million keyboards rage-tweeting about a bizarro version of the Epstein files. These details—and there are a lot of details—are eccentric without being particularly inspired. Gunn’s Superman is an overstuffed buffet composed almost entirely of Epic Bacon. Its tone is anxious, and pent-up: If there’s a character on screen who allegorizes Gunn’s directorial approach, it’s Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor, a manic, increasingly unhinged mogul striding restlessly through his high-tech command center, cashing his own blank checks and trying to find something new and edgy to say about a superhero whose greatest and most enduring virtue is that he’s a benign cipher—an icon as easy to read as an open comic book.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe inherently polarizing posture of Gunn’s cinema has been exacerbated by a fan culture that loves to use filmmakers as proxy combatants, and when it comes to the Superman movies, it is always clobbering time. At the moment, the aggressors are punch-drunk Zack Snyder loyalists, who have supposedly tried to tank Superman’s prospects in advance by posting spoilers and negative reviews and reserving tickets without paying for them. Cult leaders do inspire devotion, but in reality, Gunn and Snyder—who worked together on 2004’s intense and weirdly reactionary revamp of Dawn of the Dead—are on good terms, as evidenced by their recent, kayfabe-breaking dual cameo on Rick and Morty. (“More creatine, please,” says Snyder’s animated stand-in, waiting politely in line at the Warner Bros. commissary. “Your biceps are bigger than my head,” sighs Gunn.) For all the enmity between their respective fan bases—who frankly deserve each other—it’s worth pointing out that Gunn and Snyder’s films share a conceptual pivot point as far as their big blue leading man goes. Namely, the provocative and dramatically fertile idea—only barely developed in Richard Donner’s original 1978 Superman and pushed to the side in its increasingly cheesy sequels—that the erstwhile Clark Kent is not only an alien, but a potential invader whose corn-fed Boy Scout shtick belies some freaky, fundamental difference with humanity itself. Cue David Carradine’s wonderful monologue in Kill Bill: Vol. 2, which implies that the whole Clark persona is a form of trolling—an extraterrestrial Übermensch’s parody of workaday frailty.    ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFor Snyder, a natural-born expressionist who leans into big, building abstractions about honor and masculinity (he’s the greatest living Klingon filmmaker), the Superman myth offered a chance to flex his stylistic muscles and mount bombastic (and occasionally quite beautiful) tableaus. The sequence in Batman v. Superman when Henry Cavill touches down in Mexico during the Day of the Dead has the visual panache of a great graphic novel. Gunn is a less gifted image-maker than Snyder, and, despite his perpetually juvenile sense of humor—which worked better 20 years ago in the low-budget, gross-out B-movie context of Slither than, say, The Suicide Squad—he’s also far more politically correct, framing Superman as an “immigrant” narrative about the importance of kindness. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThat Gunn’s comments have inflamed the MAGA crowd is, ostensibly, a point in his favor: Getting two thumbs down from Kellyanne Conway and Jesse Watters on Fox News should be worn as a badge of honor. But incurring the wrath of rabid right-wing ideologues doesn’t mean that the geopolitical angle in Superman is particularly acute on its own terms—or that Gunn has the courage of his convictions. When asked in that same Times interview whether the standoff between the fictional countries of Boravia (a DC comics standby since World War II) and Jarhanpur was referring to any specific real-world conflict—whether Russia-Ukraine or Israel-Hamas—the director demurred, “Oh, I really don’t know.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nGiven Gunn’s previous antipathy toward Vladimir Putin, it’s easy enough to see the dilapidated Boravian strongman Vasil Ghurkos (Zlatko Buric) as the dictator’s toothless analog (the less said about the depiction of Jarhanpur as a helpless peasant population holding the fort with pitchforks, the better). As the film opens, Ghurkos is trying to annex his less prosperous neighbor, only for Superman to swoop in like a one-man United Nations. His unsanctioned (but bloodless) intervention is taken by world leaders as a shot across their collective bow, and gives Luthor—played by Hoult with the same gelignite gleam he brought to his domestic terrorist in The Order—the opening he desires to present himself as the great leveller, a concerned citizen with the means to watch the proverbial watchman. His pitch is to use his own private army of Metahumans (including a masked thug with suspiciously Kryptonian powers) to keep Superman in check; his plan also involves deploying bots as a form of digital kryptonite, chipping away at Superman’s reputation one hashtag at a time.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nGiven Gunn’s own tumultuous history with the social media horde,  Superman’s criticism of online mobs and cancel culture feels personal: an efficient device for dragging an old-school character into the present tense. It’s a running joke that Superman resents social media and wants to control his image. When Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane cajoles Supes into an on-the-record exclusive—which is easily done, since in this iteration of the story, she and Clark are lovers who treat his secret identity as a running joke—she touches that nerve, and a few others. And while the great His Girl Friday–style comedy about the Daily Planet remains to be made, Gunn and his actors manage to work up some sexy screwball energy in those scenes dealing with journalistic ethics—a quality that’s been in short supply since the glory days of Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, whom David Corenswet and Brosnahan duly evoke without lapsing into imitation.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThat’s a high compliment, by the way, and Corenswet—who’s got bigger puppy-dog eyes than Krypto and what Pauline Kael referred to as Reeve’s “pop jawline”—sells the through-the-wringer aspect of Gunn’s screenplay, in which Superman is frequently reduced to a kind of physical and rhetorical punching bag. For instance: An opening title card informs us that, as of “three minutes ago,” our hero has lost his first ever battle, and then, after he’s nursed back to health by his own private pit crew of helper robots, he goes down again. ⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nMaking Superman vulnerable isn’t the problem, though—it’s that Gunn doesn’t trust the Man of Steel to be the main event. Predictably, he styles Superman as a structural clone of The Suicide Squad and Guardians of the Galaxy—a sprawling, noisy ensemble piece that tries to elevate a claque of second-tier superheroes to the headliner’s level by association while also kidding their also-ran status. It’s a setup that would probably seem fresher if Thunderbolts* hadn’t done basically the same thing earlier this year, with better characters and jokes. The members of the media-savvy “Super Gang” are all charming enough on their own terms—with Fillion channeling his mock-alpha-dog performances in Super and Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog as the sullen, narcissistic Green Lantern\/Guy Gardner—without ever seeming essential. This disconnect could have worked if used satirically, and Gunn does score one genuinely hilarious set piece in this vein, when Guy and the B-team are reduced to a soundless background sight gag while Lois and Clark talk about more important things. Elsewhere, Edi Gathegi’s tech-support virtuoso Mr. Terrific gets his own kick-ass action sequence, shot (natch) in a single, hot-shit long take and scored (natch) by an ironic, contrapuntal music cue. It’s impressive in an airless sort of way, with all the excitement of a contractual obligation; when it’s over, Brosnahan—who doesn’t have nearly enough to do—whispers “Holy shit,” as if cuing us on how to react.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThere’s nothing wrong with rib-nudging, of course, and Superman’s desire to give the audience a good time isn’t all bad. Some forms of shorthand are more eloquent than others, of course, and Gunn’s reliance on electrified snatches of John Williams’s vintage theme music feels counterintuitive in ways that cut to the heart of the movie’s flaws. The contrarian impulse that compels Gunn to puff up and scoff “who cares?” when it comes to depicting Superman’s backstory—and also to revise Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster’s space-Moses origin myth by revealing Jor-El (played in holographic form by an actor not worth spoiling here) sent his son to Earth with less than benevolent intentions—bumps up against the commercialistic desire to not alienate the faithful. Basically, Gunn is trying to tear something down and build it up at the same time, and all of that lavishly subsidized indecision—blandly shot, mechanically paced, and punctuated by the kind of forced comic banter that needs ace deadpan comedians like Bradley Cooper or Dave Bautista to work—becomes hard to take after a while.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt’s telling that the most spectacular imagery in Superman concerns an inter-dimensional rift that threatens to rip the world clean in half. Perched on the edge of the uncanny valley, the best Superman and his new pals can do is try to zip things back up again: superheroism as a return to the status quo. (And, in case anybody’s worried that the stakes are too apocalyptic, Gunn makes sure there are no on-screen casualties.) As for Superman’s big, climactic speech about the failures that make him human, it’s filled with exactly the sort of vapid, hug-it-out clichés that Gunn would have kidded in his salad days, the kind that he still hasn’t quite grown up enough to sell on their own earnest terms.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAt one point in Superman, Clark tells a skeptical Lois that he considers himself to be “punk rock.” It’s a laugh line—and a funny idea—but there’s also something cynical about a $225 million movie that keeps insisting that cynicism is the enemy.

Is Gunn’s take on Superman radically optimistic or savvily noncommittal? Is it punk rock or an ersatz cover version? Is it deceptively complex or just chaotic and convoluted? Does it follow the rules or break them? Who can say? Or maybe, to Gunn’s point, the better question is: Who cares?","id":"[wp.theringer.com\/feed\/]https:\/\/wp.theringer.com\/?p=709299","content_html":"\n\n\n<p>Back in 2010, James Gunn made his sophomore feature film, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FNfMq5BwYcE\"><em>Super<\/em><\/a>, a cheap, surprisingly nasty little movie about a socially inept short-order cook who cosplays as a violent masked vigilante. Released in the wake of <em>The Dark Knight <\/em>and with <em>Iron Man <\/em>ascendant, Gunn’s film riffed on nascent superhero mania by mapping the fine line between genuine righteousness and ambient, all-American rage. “You don’t butt in line!” stammers the shabbily attired Crimson Bolt (Rainn Wilson) as he stares down the petty criminal who he imagines to be his arch enemy. “You don’t sell drugs! You don’t molest little children! You don’t profit off the misery of others! The rules were set a long time ago! They don’t change.”<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fifteen years later, Gunn is no longer in the indie-movie trenches. Instead, he parlayed his post-Tarantino instinct for recycled pop standards—exemplified by the oh-so-’70s needle drops in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy<\/em>—into an exalted status as a comic-book-movie specialist. No less than his fellow DC-Marvel switch-hitter Joss Whedon, Gunn’s work exemplifies a cultural trajectory defined by the revenge of the nerds, but he’s more apt to cultivate ugliness. Hence the paradox of his new “soft” reboot of <em>Superman<\/em>,<em> <\/em>which finds a filmmaker defined, at his best and worst, by glibness dealing with a character whose legacy is sincerity itself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-ringer-blocks-advertisement\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In interviews, Gunn has done his best to show he isn’t losing his edge, but his anti-establishment swagger is hard to square with a $225 million budget and a mandate—from noted cinephile David Zaslav—to give DC Studios’ flagship property “a coherent and creative brand strategy.” Gunn wants to have his franchise and subvert it, too. “I don’t need to see Baby Kal coming from Krypton in a little baby rocket,” he snarled in an interview with <em>The New York Times<\/em>. “We have watched a million movies with characters who don’t have their upbringing explained … who cares?”<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So what <em>do<\/em> we need to see in a <em>Superman <\/em>movie in 2025? Gunn’s answers include, but are not limited to: Lois Lane uploading a story into the <em>Daily Planet<\/em>’s<em> <\/em>CMS; Jimmy Olsen cruising through the red-light district in search of a recurring hookup listed in his phone as “Mutant Toes;” a frenetic chase scene through vomit-colored CGI that resembles <em>Mario Kart<\/em>’s Rainbow Road; Nathan Fillion in an Anton Chigurh haircut; a potentially important supporting character reduced to a drunken sorority girl; and a million monkeys at a million keyboards rage-tweeting about a bizarro version of the Epstein files. These details—and there are a <em>lot <\/em>of details—are eccentric without being particularly inspired. Gunn’s <em>Superman <\/em>is an overstuffed buffet composed almost entirely of Epic Bacon. Its tone is anxious, and pent-up: If there’s a character on screen who allegorizes Gunn’s directorial approach, it’s Nicholas Hoult’s Lex Luthor, a manic, increasingly unhinged mogul striding restlessly through his high-tech command center, cashing his own blank checks and trying to find something new and edgy to say about a superhero whose greatest and most enduring virtue is that he’s a benign cipher—an icon as easy to read as an open comic book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The inherently polarizing posture of Gunn’s cinema has been exacerbated by a fan culture that loves to use filmmakers as proxy combatants, and when it comes to the <em>Superman <\/em>movies, it is always clobbering time. At the moment, the aggressors are punch-drunk Zack Snyder loyalists, who have supposedly <a href=\"https:\/\/variety.com\/2025\/film\/news\/james-gunn-zack-snyder-fans-tank-superman-box-office-1236432913\/\">tried to tank <em>Superman<\/em>’s<em> <\/em>prospects in advance<\/a> by posting spoilers and negative reviews and reserving tickets without paying for them. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2021\/03\/16\/movies\/zack-snyder-unified-theory-justice-league-cut-director-history\">Cult leaders do inspire devotion<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/2021\/03\/16\/movies\/zack-snyder-unified-theory-justice-league-cut-director-history\"> <\/a>but in reality, Gunn and Snyder—who worked together on 2004’s intense and weirdly reactionary revamp of <em>Dawn of the Dead<\/em>—are on good terms, as evidenced by their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jmveVoBTYqs\">recent, kayfabe-breaking dual cameo on <em>Rick and Morty<\/em><\/a>. (“More creatine, please,” says Snyder’s animated stand-in, waiting politely in line at the Warner Bros. commissary. “Your biceps are bigger than my head,” sighs Gunn.) For all the enmity between their respective fan bases—who frankly deserve each other—it’s worth pointing out that Gunn and Snyder’s films share a conceptual pivot point as far as their big blue leading man goes.

This year, we're expecting an all-new iPhone 17 Air, which will be the first notable redesign to the ‌iPhone‌'s form factor since the ‌iPhone‌ 12 launched.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt's super thin. As we saw in a video of a dummy model shared by Majin Bu, the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ looks sleek and modern. It's thinner than any ‌iPhone‌ that has come before it, and we're expecting it to be super light in the hand due to the thin design.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nNo frills. Since it's thin, Apple had to cut space. There's a 48-megapixel single-lens rear camera instead of multiple cameras to swap between, so if you like a straightforward setup, this is the ‌iPhone‌ for you. No fussing with Telephoto lenses or Ultra Wide lenses, but you do get Apple's best and most versatile lens. Plus a front-facing selfie camera, of course.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nPrice. Apple's fresh new design isn't going to be the most expensive ‌iPhone‌. It's going to be priced similarly to the iPhone 16 Plus that it's replacing, and it won't be as expensive as the iPhone 17 Pro models.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe A19 Pro chip. The latest rumors say it's going to get the same A19 Pro chip that Apple plans to use for the Pro models, but with one fewer GPU core. It should also have 12GB RAM, so it's going to be a super-capable thin device.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe colors. The ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ could come in a very light blue shade that's almost silver, possibly like the M4 MacBook Air. It's also expected to be available in black, silver, and light gold, and if the black shade is similar to the dummy model in the video, it should look quite nice.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFor more on what to expect from the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌, make sure to check out our iPhone 17 Air roundup.⁠⁠\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 17 Air⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nRelated Forum: iPhone⁠⁠⁠\nThis article, \"5 Reasons to Buy an iPhone 17 Air in September\" first appeared on MacRumors.com⁠\nDiscuss this article in our forums","id":"[feeds.macrumors.com\/macrumors-all]https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/07\/10\/5-reasons-to-buy-iphone-17-air\/","content_html":"We're just a couple months away from the launch of new <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/iphone\/\">iPhone<\/a> models, and rumors are starting to really pick up.

YouTuber Jon Prosser was first to suggest that the device could be positioned as an \"‌‌iPhone&zwnj;‌ Air.\" <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/08\/12\/slim-iphone-17-could-be-iphone-air\/\"><em>Bloomberg<\/em>'s Mark Gurman<\/a> has since come out in agreement about the naming, which Apple could use to boost sales.⁠ <br\/>⁠ <br\/> Replacing the &zwnj;iPhone‌ \"Plus,\" which, like the \"mini\" models before it, has not sold well, the ‌iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Air will represent a new approach in Apple's &zwnj;iPhone‌ lineup, offering a device with a substantially thinner design that sits between the ‌iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ and &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Pro.⁠ <br\/>⁠ <br\/> Gurman believes that the design of the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Air will \"just be a step toward something better\" since Apple will eventually want to \"squeeze the power of a Pro model into this smaller design.\" However, he does not expect this to occur before 2027 at the earliest. <br\/>⁠ <br\/> <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;\">Device Thickness Rumors⁠⁠⁠\nThinner Than ‌iPhone‌ 6⁠⁠⁠\nAccording to The Information, Apple's all-new ‌iPhone 17‌ model will have a \"significantly thinner\" design with an aluminum chassis, rather than a titanium casing like Apple's Pro models.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThere have been mixed rumors on just how thin Apple will be able to make it. Rumors have hovered around 6mm, however in a recent report, reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that he expects the ‌iPhone&zwnj;‌ to measure in at about 5.5mm at its thinnest point. At 5.5mm, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Air would be the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to date – thinner than the 6.9mm &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 6 that came out in 2014. 5.5mm would be approximately 30% thinner than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-16\/\">iPhone 16<\/a>, which measures in at 7.8mm thick, and 33% thinner than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-16-pro\/\">iPhone 16 Pro<\/a> models, which are 8.25mm thick.⁠ <br\/>⁠ <br\/> <img src=\"https:\/\/images.macrumors.com\/article-new\/2025\/01\/iPhone-16-Pro-vs-iPhone-17-Air-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-985932\" \/> <br\/> The device is said to have only a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/11\/25\/iphone-17-air-features-reported\/\">single speaker<\/a>, in the earpiece, as there is apparently not enough room for a second speaker on the bottom edge. <em>The Information<\/em> also claims that the device will feature a narrower <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/dynamic-island\/\">Dynamic Island<\/a>, though this specific claim has since been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/07\/24\/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs\/\">contested<\/a>. Internally code-named D23, the device's redesign has been described as a major one equivalent to the &zwnj;iPhone‌ X.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nDisplay Size⁠⁠⁠\nSmaller Than Plus Model⁠⁠⁠\nThe first details about the size of the device's display arrived courtesy of Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, who said it would be 6.6 inches. Apple analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ has since corroborated Pu's claim.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nDisplay Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young says the device will feature a 6.55-inch display, which could be rounded up to 6.6 inches. Complicating matters, YouTuber ‌Jon Prosser‌ more recently claimed that the iPhone 17 Air will be equipped with a 6.7-inch display, rather than a 6.6-inch display as previously rumored. For context, the existing ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus has a 6.7-inch display. However, in response to Prosser's prediction, Young reiterated his 6.55-inch display size claim for the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIn mid-March 2025, we reported on a rumor out of China claiming that the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ shares the same dimensions as the iPhone 17 Pro Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices. Days later, Bloomberg reported that Apple prototyped a larger ultra-slim ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ with a 6.9-inch display, but ultimately decided not to go ahead with the device because of fears that it could be susceptible to bending. It's quite possible the China-originating rumor had its origins in Apple's canned prototype.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ could have ultra-thin bezels as could the entire ‌iPhone 17‌ series, according to one leaker. Apple says the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max feature the thinnest bezels around the screen of any product it has ever released, so perhaps we can expect a similar sized bezel for the Air.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAlways-On Display⁠⁠⁠\nProMotion Support⁠⁠⁠\nApple intends to expand ProMotion to the entire lineup in 2025, including the iPhone 17 \"Air,\" allowing all ‌iPhone 17‌ models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary. This will be enabled by Apple's use of Samsung's high performance \"M14\" OLED display panel.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nPreviously, only \"Pro\" models in Apple's ‌iPhone‌ lineup used the M1 OLED panel, which is why they have exclusively supported ProMotion. Notably, ProMotion would also enable the display on the ‌iPhone 17‌ \"Air\" to ramp down to a more power-efficient refresh rate as low as 1Hz, allowing for an always-on display that can show the Lock Screen's clock, widgets, notifications, and wallpaper even when the device is locked.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nCamera Redesign⁠⁠⁠\nRelocated Lens⁠⁠⁠\nThe Information claimed that the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ will have cameras in locations we haven't seen before on an ‌iPhone‌. According to a May report, the rear cameras could be moved to the \"top center\" of the device. Some Android phones like Google's Pixel 9 Pro have rear cameras in a top-center position, or in a runway-style horizontal bar, but Apple's ‌iPhone‌ camera system has occupied the top-left corner ever since the 2007 model.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAdding to the intrigue, Apple analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ has claimed that the device will have only one camera, as opposed to two or three.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSince then, YouTube channel Front Page Tech has revealed the alleged design of the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌. The renders show an all-new camera bar across the top of the device's rear shell. On the left side of the bar is a single rear camera, and on the right side there is a microphone and an LED camera flash.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nMost recently, a CAD render of all the devices in Apple's upcoming ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup has been shared online by leaker Majin Bu, specifically showing the allegedly different rear camera system designs of the standard ‌iPhone 17‌, including the all-new ultra-thin ‌iPhone 17 Air‌. The CAD shows the described horizontal camera bar design accommodating the single camera lens.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAlleged ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ shown on far left⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWeibo-based leakers Fixed Focus Digital, Ice Universe, and Digital Chat Station have all backed the accuracy of the CAD image, based on their own information from Apple's supply chain in China. \"The appearance is basically like this,\" commented Digital Chat Station in reference to the image.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nMore Durable Screen⁠⁠⁠\nAnti-Reflective Coating⁠⁠⁠\nAll ‌iPhone 17‌ models will feature an anti-reflective display that is more scratch-resistant than Apple's Ceramic Shield found on iPhone 15 models, according to Chinese Weibo leaker Instant Digital.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe outer glass on the ‌iPhone 17‌ series is said to have a \"super-hard anti-reflective layer\" that is \"more scratch-resistant.\" It's not clear whether Apple is planning to adopt the Gorilla Glass Armor that Samsung uses in its Galaxy S24 Ultra, but the description of Corning's latest technology matches the rumor.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nImproved Front Camera⁠⁠⁠\nBetter Selfies⁠⁠⁠\nAccording to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the entire ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup will feature a 24-megapixel front-facing camera with a six-element lens. The ‌iPhone‌ 14 and 15 feature a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with five plastic lens elements, and the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup features the same hardware.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe upgraded resolution on the ‌iPhone 17‌ will allow photos to maintain their quality even when cropped or zoomed in, while the larger number of pixels will capture finer details. The upgrade to a six-element lens should also slightly enhance image quality.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nMore RAM⁠⁠⁠\nApple Intelligence⁠⁠⁠\nHaitong analyst Jeff Pu has claimed the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ will feature 8GB of RAM, compared to 6GB of RAM on the ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus. However, more recently, ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌ has said that all ‌iPhone 17‌ models will be equipped with 12GB of RAM, including the Air.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIt's worth noting that all ‌iPhone 16‌ models (including the new iPhone 16e) are fitted with 8GB of RAM – a hardware requirement of on-device ‌Apple Intelligence‌ – so it's almost a surety that the slim device will also have at least this amount of memory.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nNext-Gen Processor⁠⁠⁠\nBetter Performance⁠⁠⁠\nAccording to The Information and Haitong International analyst Jeff Pu, the device will be equipped with Apple's A19 chip, which is likely to be based on an optimized version of TSMC's 3nm process, possibly N3P or N3X.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIn contrast, the ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 17 Pro‌ Max are expected to include an A19 Pro chip. Compared to earlier versions of ‌3nm‌ chips, the N3P chips offer increased performance efficiency and increased transistor density.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBattery Life⁠⁠⁠\nQuestions Remain⁠⁠⁠\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and industry analyst ‌Ming-Chi Kuo‌, the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ will utilize the same C1 modem that recently debuted in the iPhone 16e. The C1 is Apple's first custom-designed modem chip, and should bring significant advantages to the upcoming ‌iPhone 17 Air‌.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe C1 is the most power-efficient modem ever featured in an ‌iPhone‌, and promises very good battery life even within the frame of the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌'s ultra-thin design. According to Apple's tech specs, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ offers up to 26 hours of battery life for video playback, compared to up to 22 hours for the standard ‌iPhone 16‌. This efficiency comes from Apple's complete control over the modem's design and integration with its custom silicon. The only minor drawback to the C1 is that it does not support mmWave.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ could become the first Apple smartphone to adopt advanced battery technology, with Japanese supplier TDK preparing to ship its new generation of silicon-anode batteries by the end of June. One leaker has claimed the device's battery capacity is 2,800mAh, which wouldn't be far off the ‌iPhone‌ 12, which has a 2,815mAh battery.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBloomberg reporter ‌Mark Gurman‌ has said the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ will provide battery life that is \"on par with current iPhones.\" However, according to a report by The Information, the device will have \"worse\" battery life compared to previous ‌iPhone‌ models, which could influence Apple's decision to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nCamera Control⁠⁠⁠\nPhotography Button⁠⁠⁠\nThe ‌iPhone 17 Air‌ will feature the same Camera Control button that ‌iPhone 16‌ models have on the right-side of the device, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The button provides quick access to the camera and related settings, but some people find the button's touch sensitivity finicky, and many users disable it.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWi-Fi 7 Support⁠⁠⁠\nFor Enhanced Connectivity⁠⁠⁠\nApple will use its own custom-designed Wi-Fi chip in all upcoming ‌iPhone 17‌ models, including the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌, according to industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Kuo said the switch to in-house Wi-Fi chips will \"enhance connectivity across Apple devices\" while also giving Apple a cost reduction.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nApple's custom wireless chip will support Wi-Fi 7 specification, according to Jeff Pu, an analyst who covers companies within Apple's supply chain. All current ‌iPhone‌ models are equipped with a combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip supplied by Broadcom.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nMagSafe⁠⁠⁠\nFor Wireless Charging⁠⁠⁠\nDespite the thinness of the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌, the device will support ‌MagSafe‌, according to a reliable Chinese leaker. The leaker said that all four ‌iPhone 17‌ models this year will support ‌MagSafe‌ for magnetic wireless charging and magnetic accessories. Apple dropped ‌MagSafe‌ from the low-end ‌iPhone 16e‌, which left some uncertainty that the technology would feature in the ‌iPhone 17 Air‌.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nNotably, Apple appears to be moving to the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, according to regulatory filings, which increases the likelihood that the upcoming ‌iPhone 17‌ models will support the new charging standard. Qi 2.2 is technically capable of up to 50W charging output – but that doesn't guarantee Apple's iPhones will charge at the maximum 50W. In addition to faster charging, Qi 2.2 offers improved magnetic alignment and charging efficiency compared to its predecessor. The standard also features backward compatibility with older Qi chargers.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\neSIM Worldwide⁠⁠⁠\nNo SIM Card Slot⁠⁠⁠\nThe slim device will lack a physical SIM card slot, and instead rely entirely on digital eSIM technology, according to Ming-Chi Kuo. In the U.S., all ‌iPhone‌ 14, ‌iPhone 15‌, and ‌iPhone 16‌ models lack a physical SIM card tray already, but all iPhones sold in other countries still have one for now.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe lack of a SIM card slot in all forthcoming ‌iPhone 17‌ models worldwide has been previously reported, but it is not clear how the devices would be sold in the Chinese market, where the use of eSIMs in smartphones is not currently authorized.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nColor Options⁠⁠⁠\nUnique Blue Finish⁠⁠⁠\nA new light blue finish is rumored to be the signature color of the all-new ultra-thin ‌iPhone 17 Air‌, according to a leak from Asia. The tip, shared by Weibo leaker \"Fixed Focus Digital,\" suggests that this blue shade will be central to Apple's marketing for the new device, which will replace the Plus model in Apple's ‌iPhone‌ lineup. Described as significantly lighter than any previous blue Apple has released, the color may appear almost white in low-light conditions.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe ‌iPhone‌ 13 Pro's \"Sierra Blue\" finish (2021).⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe finish is said to echo Apple's past use of lighter tones, particularly the ‌iPhone‌ 13 Pro's \"Sierra Blue.\" That color marked a shift toward more subtle, pastel-like shades – metallic and icy, it shifted between blue and light gray depending on the lighting. Apple continued this trend with the softer, pastel finishes introduced in the ‌iPhone 15‌ lineup.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nPricing Rumors⁠⁠⁠\nPremium or Affordable?⁠⁠⁠\nThe Information reported that the slimmer ‌iPhone 17‌ could have a higher price tag than the Pro Max model, which currently starts at $1,199, despite suggestions that it will not be as feature-rich as Apple's top-tier Max.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nHowever, Haitong International analyst Jeff Pu believes the device will be a mid-tier ‌iPhone‌ that replaces the Plus model. Additionally, a report out of China has claimed that the ultra-thin ‌iPhone 17‌'s price will be similar to that of the ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, which starts at $899 in the United States. More recently, Bloomberg's ‌Mark Gurman‌ said he was told that the device may start at roughly $899 in the US, while a newer report by The Wall Street Journal has suggested that all ‌iPhone 17‌ models may have higher prices than usual because of the impact of U.S. import tariffs on foreign goods.⁠⁠⁠\nRelated Roundup: iPhone 17 Air⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nRelated Forum: iPhone⁠⁠⁠\nThis article, \"iPhone 17 Air Design, Specs, and More: All the Rumors So Far\" first appeared on MacRumors.com⁠\nDiscuss this article in our forums","id":"[feeds.macrumors.com\/macrumors-all]https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/07\/09\/iphone-17-air-design-specs-rumors-so-far\/","content_html":"<strong>Latest Update<\/strong>: July 8 – <a href=\"#color\">iPhone 17 Air to come in new light blue finish<\/a>\n<br \/>\n<hr \/>\n<br \/>\nThis year, Apple is expected to discontinue the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/iphone\/\">iPhone<\/a> \"Plus\" device in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-17\/\">iPhone 17<\/a> lineup to make way for an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; \"Air,\" so-called because of its ultra-thin profile.  \n<br \/>\n\n<br \/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/images.macrumors.com\/article-new\/2025\/04\/iPhone-17-Air-Fanned-Out-Rainbow-Single-Color-Module-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-999800\" \/>\n<br \/>\nBelow is a compilation of every rumor and leak we have registered from reputable sources thus far about Apple's new entry in its flagship smartphone lineup. \n<br \/>\n\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;\">&zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; \"Air\"?<\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;\">About the Name<\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\nThere has been some uncertainty about Apple's strategy for the new slimmer &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; model and its position in the lineup.

Rumors have hovered around 6mm, however in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/01\/10\/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo\/\">recent report<\/a>, reliable Apple analyst <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/ming-chi-kuo\/\">Ming-Chi Kuo<\/a> said that he expects the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to measure in at about 5.5mm at its thinnest point. At 5.5mm, the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;‌ Air would be the thinnest &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ to date – thinner than the 6.9mm &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;‌ 6 that came out in 2014. 5.5mm would be approximately 30% thinner than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-16\/\">iPhone 16<\/a>, which measures in at 7.8mm thick, and 33% thinner than the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-16-pro\/\">iPhone 16 Pro<\/a> models, which are 8.25mm thick. \n<br\/>\n\n<br\/>\n<img src=\"https:\/\/images.macrumors.com\/article-new\/2025\/01\/iPhone-16-Pro-vs-iPhone-17-Air-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-985932\" \/>\n<br\/>\nThe device is said to have only a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/11\/25\/iphone-17-air-features-reported\/\">single speaker<\/a>, in the earpiece, as there is apparently not enough room for a second speaker on the bottom edge. <em>The Information<\/em> also claims that the device will feature a narrower <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/guide\/dynamic-island\/\">Dynamic Island<\/a>, though this specific claim has since been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/07\/24\/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs\/\">contested<\/a>.

Apple analyst &zwnj;Ming-Chi Kuo&zwnj; has since <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/07\/24\/kuo-ultra-thin-iphone-17-specs\/\">corroborated<\/a> Pu's claim. \n<br \/>\n\n<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/05\/06\/iphone-17-slim-to-feature-6-55-inch-display\/\">Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young<\/a> says the device will feature a 6.55-inch display, which could be rounded up to 6.6 inches. Complicating matters, YouTuber &zwnj;Jon Prosser&zwnj; more recently claimed that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-17-air\/\">iPhone 17 Air<\/a> will be equipped with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/02\/20\/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display\/\">6.7-inch display<\/a>, rather than a 6.6-inch display as previously rumored. For context, the existing &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Plus has a 6.7-inch display. However, in response to Prosser's prediction, Young reiterated his 6.55-inch display size claim for the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;.\n<br \/>\n\n<br \/>\nIn mid-March 2025, we reported on a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/03\/07\/iphone-17-air-same-size-iphone-16-pro-max\/\">rumor out of China<\/a> claiming that the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; shares the same dimensions as the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/roundup\/iphone-17-pro\/\">iPhone 17 Pro<\/a> Max, with the only difference being in the thickness of the devices. Days later, <em>Bloomberg<\/em> reported that Apple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/03\/17\/larger-iphone-17-air-referred-to-prototype\/\">prototyped<\/a> a larger ultra-slim &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; with a 6.9-inch display, but ultimately decided not to go ahead with the device because of fears that it could be susceptible to bending. It's quite possible the China-originating rumor had its origins in Apple's canned prototype.\n<br \/>\n\n<br \/>\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj; could have ultra-thin bezels as could the entire &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; series, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/07\/07\/iphone-17-and-17-air-thinner-bezels-rumor\/\">according to one leaker<\/a>. Apple says the &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;iPhone 16 Pro&zwnj; Max feature the thinnest bezels around the screen of any product it has ever released, so perhaps we can expect a similar sized bezel for the Air. \n<br \/>\n\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px; color: #4A90E2; margin-top: 2px;\">Always-On Display<\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-size: 14px; color: #FFFFFF; background-color: #4A90E2; padding: 3px 6px; border-radius: 4px; margin-bottom: 2px;\">ProMotion Support<\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\nApple intends to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2023\/04\/03\/promotion-standard-iphones-2025\/\">expand<\/a> ProMotion to the entire lineup in 2025, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2024\/09\/20\/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor\/\">including the iPhone 17 \"Air,\"<\/a> allowing all &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models to ramp up to a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video content when necessary.

The leaker said that all four &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models this year will support &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; for magnetic wireless charging and magnetic accessories. Apple dropped &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; from the low-end &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which left some uncertainty that the technology would feature in the &zwnj;iPhone 17 Air&zwnj;.\n<br \/>\n\n<br \/>\nNotably, Apple appears to be moving to the next-generation Qi 2.2 wireless charging standard, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2025\/06\/05\/iphone-17-support-50w-magsafe-wireless-charging\/\">regulatory filings<\/a>, which increases the likelihood that the upcoming &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models will support the new charging standard. Qi 2.2 is technically capable of up to 50W charging output – but that doesn't guarantee Apple's iPhones will charge at the maximum 50W. In addition to faster charging, Qi 2.2 offers improved magnetic alignment and charging efficiency compared to its predecessor.

Screenshot: Nintendo⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nVideo games take longer to make than ever before. See the longer waits for Assassin’s Creed and Grand Thefty Auto sequels. Or, with Nintendo, notice the widening gaps between 3D Zelda adventures.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSee Naughty Dog’s crawling output: their last new game came out in 2020, next new game in who-knows-when.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSee the warning, in 2023, from Xbox’s head of game studios that fans needed to brace themselves for game development cycles that last “four and five and six years.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSee Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa telling investors in spring 2024 that “[t]he process of game development will inevitably become longer, more complex, and more advanced.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nDevelopers aren’t lazy. Games just keep getting bigger and more complicated. Their graphics have become more advanced and labor-intensive to produce. As fans also expect more, games take more time to create. I can’t count how many people in the games industry who’ve told me this is a key challenge that has shaken up the business, as longer dev times require bigger budgets and bigger budgets raise the stakes around a game’s success or failure.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAnd here is Furukawa again, this time in dialogue with a Nintendo shareholder late last month, via a recently translated Q&A.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nHe is asked:⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nI am concerned that the improved performance of Nintendo Switch 2 will lead to higher game development costs, which in turn could result in higher software prices and ultimately a decrease in the gaming population. What measures are you considering to address this?⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFurukawa replies:⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nRecent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs. The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nOur development teams are devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development. We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWere that all he said, there’d be nothing to write about. The president of Nintendo saying the moon is far away is not news. But it is news when he adds that they have ideas about how to go there more quickly.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nTo that shareholder, Furukawa continued [emphasis added by me]:⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWe also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty. We see this as one potential solution to the concern about rising development costs and software prices, and we will explore it from various angles within the company.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWhat ever could this mean?⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nHow might Nintendo “develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty”?⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWhat could its “various angles” of exploration be?⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nNintendo games launched in unfinished early access? Doesn’t sound like them.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nA return to the occasional release of smaller, more experimental games from Nintendo? They used to release loads of them—the Pushmos, the Art Styles, the Box Boys—interspersed between big full-priced games. That was back when Nintendo had a business incentive to offer cheaper, small downloadable games to drive users to its nascent DSiWare and WiiWare and other pre-Switch online shops. That was before downloads of full-priced, full-sized games became more viable and the release of those smaller games subsequently slowed.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSome other approach that I’m not thinking of? And that you’re not thinking of either? Hey, it’s Nintendo. This is usually the correct answer.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nI wasn’t expecting a big announcement from Furukawa during that Q&A. I wasn’t expecting him to mention a new 3D Mario, a new Animal Crossing nor the resumption of development of Emperor of the Jungle.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBut if Nintendo can find a way to shorten development cycles in some high-quality way, he may have made the most important announcement of all.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nKeep reading for more reporting about Nintendo’s average annual salaries, mixed stats regarding female managers at Nintendo, the company’s unusual new director…. the latest allegations in the lawsuit between IGN’s owners and the makers of ChatGPT… some clarity (and a dash of news) about Romero Games… the state of The Alters’ AI flap, and more…⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nRead more","id":"[gamefile.news\/feed\/]https:\/\/www.gamefile.news\/p\/nintendo-development-speed-headcount-female-managers","content_html":"<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/substackcdn.com\/image\/fetch\/$s_!B6fZ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep\/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae324bc-000a-40aa-8158-3c88b58f5dc5_3840x2160.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image\/webp\" srcset=\"https:\/\/substackcdn.com\/image\/fetch\/$s_!B6fZ!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep\/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae324bc-000a-40aa-8158-3c88b58f5dc5_3840x2160.png 424w, https:\/\/substackcdn.com\/image\/fetch\/$s_!B6fZ!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep\/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae324bc-000a-40aa-8158-3c88b58f5dc5_3840x2160.png 848w, https:\/\/substackcdn.com\/image\/fetch\/$s_!B6fZ!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep\/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae324bc-000a-40aa-8158-3c88b58f5dc5_3840x2160.png 1272w, https:\/\/substackcdn.com\/image\/fetch\/$s_!B6fZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep\/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae324bc-000a-40aa-8158-3c88b58f5dc5_3840x2160.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https:\/\/substackcdn.com\/image\/fetch\/$s_!B6fZ!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep\/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ae324bc-000a-40aa-8158-3c88b58f5dc5_3840x2160.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" data-attrs=\"{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com\/public\/images\/9ae324bc-000a-40aa-8158-3c88b58f5dc5_3840x2160.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:7693631,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Video game screenshot of Nintendo character Luigi on a green motorcycle.

Games just keep getting bigger and more complicated. Their graphics have become more advanced and labor-intensive to produce. As fans also expect more, games take more time to create. I can&#8217;t count how many people in the games industry who&#8217;ve told me this is a key challenge that has shaken up the business, as longer dev times require bigger budgets and bigger budgets raise the stakes around a game&#8217;s success or failure.<\/p><p>And here is Furukawa again, this time in dialogue with a Nintendo shareholder late last month, via a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nintendo.co.jp\/ir\/pdf\/2025\/qa2506e.pdf\">recently translated Q&amp;A<\/a>.<\/p><p>He is asked:<\/p><blockquote><p>I am concerned that the improved performance of Nintendo Switch 2 will lead to higher game development costs, which in turn could result in higher software prices and ultimately a decrease in the gaming population. What measures are you considering to address this?<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Furukawa replies:<\/p><blockquote><p>Recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs. The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk.<\/p><p>Our development teams are devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development. We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>Were that all he said, there&#8217;d be nothing to write about. The president of Nintendo saying the moon is far away is not news. But it is news when he adds that they have ideas about how to go there more quickly.<\/p><p>To that shareholder, Furukawa continued [emphasis added by me]:<\/p><blockquote><p><strong>We also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty.<\/strong> We see this as one potential solution to the concern about rising development costs and software prices, and we will explore it from various angles within the company.<\/p><\/blockquote><p>What ever could this mean?<\/p><p>How might Nintendo &#8220;develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty&#8221;?<\/p><p>What could its &#8220;various angles&#8221; of exploration be?<\/p><ul><li><p><strong>Nintendo games launched in unfinished early access? <\/strong>Doesn&#8217;t sound like them.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><ul><li><p><strong>A return to the occasional release of smaller, more experimental games from Nintendo?<\/strong> They used to release loads of them&#8212;the <a href=\"https:\/\/nintendo.fandom.com\/wiki\/Pushmo_(series)\">Pushmo<\/a>s, the <a href=\"https:\/\/kotaku.com\/art-style-boxlife-micro-review-smart-misery-5303027\">Art Style<\/a>s, the <a href=\"https:\/\/kotaku.com\/the-guy-behind-one-of-the-year-s-best-3ds-games-1702235041\">Box Boys<\/a>&#8212;interspersed between big full-priced games. That was back when Nintendo had a business incentive to offer cheaper, small downloadable games to drive users to its nascent DSiWare and WiiWare and other pre-Switch online shops. That was before downloads of full-priced, full-sized games became more viable and the release of those smaller games subsequently slowed. <\/p><\/li><li><p><strong>Some other approach that I&#8217;m not thinking of?

The 1TB version of the SSD is on sale for 26% off, too.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nApple Gear⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAirPods Pro 2.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThere are some great Apple hardware deals available for Prime Day, including:⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAirPods Pro 2, which are $79 off, their lowest price ever on Amazon⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAirPods 4 without active noise cancellation for 23% off⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nBeats Solo 4 for 50% off⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nApple Watch Series 10 for 29% off⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe latest iPad mini with 128GB of storage and cellular connectivity for 18% off⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe Apple Watch 2 Ultra with cellular for 18% off⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAirTags for 21% off individually and 31% off for a 4-pack⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWi-Fi 7 Mesh Routers⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nEarlier this year, I upgraded my Wi-Fi to a TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 Mesh system. I came from a Wi-Fi 6E system and was pleasantly surprised to find that TP-Link’s Deco BE95 Wi-Fi 7 BE22000 routers are substantially faster. I’ve had the setup for about three months, and I love it. During Prime Day, you can get the routers individually or in a three-pack for 30% off.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLighting⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe Philips Hue Festavia string lights.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe 65-foot-long Philips Hue Festavia Lights that decorate my balcony are 30% off for Prime Day, as is the Philips Hue Play HDMI Sync Box 8K, which Federico swears by for mood lighting behind his TV. A four-pack of Hue 60W equivalent A19 color-changing smart bulbs is 41% off, too. It’s a great deal, and so is the 33% you can save on a four-pack of the recessed Hue lights that Federico added to his setup today.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLogitech Peripherals⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLogitech’s Keys-to-Go 2.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nI’ve used Logitech keyboards and mice for a long time. For Prime Day, the company is offering its Keys-to-Go 2 keyboard, the slimmest and most usable small keyboard I’ve ever tried, for 25% off. The POP Mouse, which I use with a variety of handheld gaming devices and the Mac mini, is also on sale for 37% off. Finally, the Logitech C922x HD webcam is 37% off. I haven’t used mine since I went 4K, but if you’re looking for a 1080p webcam, the C922x is my personal favorite.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nElgato Gear and Gaming⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nElgato’s Prompter.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nEarlier this year, I purchased an Elgato Prompter that uses mirrors to reflect a second Mac screen in front of a camera for recording videos. It’s a clever setup that works not only with Elgato’s webcams, but also with DSLRs and even iPhones, which is how I use it. During Prime Day, the Prompter is 33% off.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nTwo other handy podcasting tools I use every week are on sale too. The Elgato Key Light is 22% off during Prime Day, and the Wave Mic Arm is 30% off.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nElgato’s 4K capture card, which is compatible with HDMI 2.1, is on sale during Prime Day for 20% off. It’s one of the best ways I’ve found for capturing videogame footage or anything else that connects via HDMI.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nRazer Kishi Ultra.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nSpeaking of games, Razer’s Kishi Ultra controller for the iPhone is also available at a deep 33% discount during Prime Day. The Kishi Ultra is on the large size of iPhone controllers, but as long as that isn’t an issue, you can’t find a better controller to drop your phone into.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nAccess Extra Content and Perks⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nFounded in 2015, Club MacStories has delivered exclusive content every week for nearly a decade.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nWhat started with weekly and monthly email newsletters has blossomed into a family of memberships designed every MacStories fan.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nClub MacStories: Weekly and monthly newsletters via email and the web that are brimming with apps, tips, automation workflows, longform writing, early access to the MacStories Unwind podcast, periodic giveaways, and more;⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nClub MacStories+: Everything that Club MacStories offers, plus an active Discord community, advanced search and custom RSS features for exploring the Club’s entire back catalog, bonus columns, and dozens of app discounts;⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nClub Premier: All of the above and AppStories+, an extended version of our flagship podcast that’s delivered early, ad-free, and in high-bitrate audio.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nLearn more here and from our Club FAQs.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nJoin Now","id":"[macstories.net\/feed]https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/?p=78912","content_html":"<div class=\"media-wrapper\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.macstories.net\/screenshot-2025-07-08-at-9-31-26-am-1751981763122.png\" alt=\"\" \/><p class=\"image-caption\"><\/p><\/div>\n<p id=\"p2\">You&rsquo;re sure to see a lot of Prime Day roundups around the web today, but ours is a little different.

But as development costs skyrocket across the industry, Nintendo seems to have a plan to keep things in control as it transitions into the Switch 2 era.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nIn response to a question during a recent shareholders meeting about the increased costs of making games for its new console, Nintendo president Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa admitted that “recent game software development has become larger in scale and longer in duration, resulting in higher development costs. The game business has always been a high-risk business, and we recognize that rising development costs are increasing that risk.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nHowever, he said that Nintendo’s development teams are “currently devising various ways to maintain our traditional approach to creating games amidst the increasing scale and length of development. We believe it is important to make the necessary investments for more efficient development.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n“The game business has always been a high-risk business.”⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nThe early lineup of first-party Switch 2 games has already shown Nintendo being more ambitious with its franchises on the enhanced hardware. Mario Kart World introduced an open-world structure to the long-running racing series, while the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza adds an impressive destructive element to a more traditional 3D platforming experience. This has come with increased costs for consumers; World sells for $79.99, $10 more than most Nintendo games, while the Switch 2 itself is $449.99, a $100 jump over the Switch OLED. (In response to a question about these prices making it harder to reach younger audiences, Furukawa said that “we are closely monitoring to what degree the price of the system might become a barrier.”)⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\nOf course, Nintendo is not alone, and the increased scale of game development has been disastrous for many of its competitors. Just last week Microsoft’s gaming division was hit hard by layoffs and game cancellations, while high-profile games like Black Panther and Concord were both shut down alongside their development studios. Nintendo has been one of the rare exceptions in the floundering game industry, but keeping that up will become increasingly challenging as games get bigger. Then again, Furukawa offered one concrete way of combatting this: more smaller games.⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠\n”We also believe it is possible to develop game software with shorter development periods that still offer consumers a sense of novelty,“ Furukawa said. ”We see this as one potential solution to the concern about rising development costs and software prices, and we will explore it from various angles within the company.“","id":"[theverge.com\/rss\/full.xml]https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/?p=699429","content_html":"<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.theverge.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/2\/2025\/06\/257769_Switch_2_AKrales_0395_588c1a.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" \/>\n <figcaption>\n  <\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A bigger, more powerful Switch means bigger, more intensive games that take more time and money to make.
