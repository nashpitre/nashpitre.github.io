## Recap

I have more to share, but I’ll wait for the November Recap to breakdown everything.

## Moving

I spent the month preparing to move. Downsized to the bare minimum. I had a plan in the first week of November of what I’d want to bring to my new location, and I’ve stuck to that exact list. It would freak most people out by how little possessions I actually own. It feels so freeing for me, though.

## Thankful

November is a thankful month, but I’ve had many Novembers in my life. This has been my [favorite][1] in a long time. The stability and peace I see in my family right now is unfortunately rare, but it feels like everything is moving in the right direction for everyone. I look around me and see people that are good. They may not be doing as well as they want to be, but I’m not scared for them anymore. That lifts so much weight off of my shoulders.

## For My Brother

I started a video series: For My Brother ([001][2] and [002][3], so far). It fits so well into my life. My little brother is always with me. He’s cool. I bought a GoPro. I don’t like being front and center with my art, but I like making art. He likes being The Cameraman, he points the camera at me occasionally, but mostly, we get to experience his perspective. It’s been a blast working on these with him, and it gives him something creative for his little 8 year old mind. He looks up to YouTubers, and we’re making cool videos like them now. I’m sure I’m getting brownie points because of this.

## Creative Minds: November

We’re a few days away from the latest Creative Minds. It’s always weird leading up to these events: there’s no telling how many people to plan for. 15 could show up, 5 could show up, or 30 could show up. I look forward to more consistency each month with the group. It’ll come with time, and the upcoming January Rally Day, where we promote our groups.

## Better Call Saul

Laying in bed, watching the last few episodes of Better Call Saul: Season 3 on Netflix. A very underrated show.

## I Met Someone

That’s all I’ll say for now.
