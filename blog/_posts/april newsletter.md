## Intro

This email is a new structure for me that fits my style of writing a lot more (Ulysses sheets, separated on my end, and then connected on your end when they arrive in your inbox). I’m hoping these little details are welcomed. Let me know what you think, and as always, **reply to this email** to say hello.
## Do

Collect. Process. Plan. Do.

> “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” — Albert Einstein

Write down everything on your mind, decide what to do with each item, plan out your week with what’s most important each day, then start doing them. Repeat.

A friend of mine told me she wants to ‘do more and not settle’, so I wrote [something][2] to help her.

## Work

I started a new job recently, I discussed it, and the end of retail [here][3]. I attended the Louisiana Labor Summit last month, and took a bunch of [pictures][4] while I was there. I’ll also be traveling to Indianapolis in May, and Galveston in June, so expect more photoblogs for those.

## Hiking

I went hiking last weekend, and I took some [pictures][5] of our trip. I have three more trips planned in the next few weeks, so expect pictures from those too.

## Watch

I made a [page][6] for all of my favorite things to watch, broken down by each year. I kept the page as simple as possible: I didn’t explain where the show is playing, or a link to get to it—just a simple list of my favorites. Highly recommend these.
## Social

I’ve slowly been [removing][7] social networks from my life, so if you’re subscribed to my mailing list, congrats! You’ve just received a one-time complimentary upgrade. This (the email and my blog) is simple compared to the alternatives. It’s the most personal and direct way for me to reach out to you, and I’m constantly thinking about how to include you in the process. 

*I blog daily, but not everything needs to be brought to your attention (unless you directly visit [nashp.com][8]).*

Social networks feel like a dumpster fire now (or a burning house), and we’re all on the outside looking in, roasting marshmallows that’s attached to coat hangers, wondering where our friends will end up next.

If you’re fed up with whatever social book you’re on, maybe you should have a little blog too. Let me know by picking a date on my [schedule][9], and I’ll help you set up one in no time. We all deserve our own little space on the internet, nothing too big or loud, but it’s ours.

## Rockets

As most of you know, I’ve followed Chris Paul since the beginning of his career—with New Orleans, with the Clippers, and now with the Rockets. This has been by far the best team he’s been on, thanks to James Harden and the innovative system that coach Mike D’Antoni has implemented.

Before the season started, I shared my thoughts about them [as a team][10], and just recently, I [concluded][11] my thoughts for the season. They’re now the favorites to make it to the finals, even though many predict them to still lose to the Warriors. Basically, this could finally be the year for Chris Paul to win a championship.

Have a great weekend.
