title: The Unknown

The unknown. The uncertainty. What tomorrow might hold. We’re afraid of it. The fear of not knowing paralyzes us to the point that we're now on the sidelines, watching life happen around us. Frozen on defense. Afraid of the moving target instead of taking action on what’s ahead.

During the unknown, that's when the biggest moments of our life could happen. It's these moments that’ll define us going forward. There's an opportunity here, to be excited, simply by understanding that the breakthrough is next, and it’s time to get ready for it.

Your future self—the best version of yourself—starts with the preparation of today.
