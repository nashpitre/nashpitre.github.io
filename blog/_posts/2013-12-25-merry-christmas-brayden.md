# Merry Christmas, Brayden

This kid is full of life and is always curious and adventurous. Legos, remote helicopters, four wheelers: he does all of these things like a six year old, but he’s only three. I love how clear his sentences are now—I can have great conversations with him that are very entertaining. It’s always a pleasure to hang out with him.
