# Mental Health. Make An Impact. Be Thankful.

I want to update you on a few things that’s going on right now. You have an opportunity to join me on this current project that I’m wrapping up.

I've already accomplished a lot in my young life, but I feel like it's all been things that have only been surface deep. Which means I'm just getting started. Which means that I'm aiming for the core now. For the root. For your heart. My new theme in life, and in everything I create: Be the light.

There’s only 24 hours in a day, and with each hour, there’s so much that could be done. But let’s be honest with each other: you’ve been complacent lately. Me too (until recently). I want to help you break that complacency the same way I did. Let me tell you what I been up to. You don’t want to miss this.

## One

“The Illusion of Progress” is the name. It’s a story about mental health and finding God. It’s a new album that’ll be on Spotify and Apple Music, and it’s a book that’ll be on Apple Books and Amazon Kindle. There’s professional music videos currently being filmed. There’s live instruments being played everywhere. There’s people’s heartfelt stories that are being recorded and shared throughout every track. I already have over 20 people included on the album since announcing this project two weeks ago. So many people reached out to me join in. Voices and instruments are everywhere. Some are reading poems, some are telling their testimonies of someone they’ve lost from suicide or an overdose. Every song has a voice somewheres, and it sounds incredible. It’s almost done, but there’s still time for you to be a part of it if you're feeling inspired. Just let me know that you’re interested. I’ll take care of the rest.

I’ve had more growth and fire in this little season (these last few weeks), than I usually do in an entire year. Something big is happening, and it’s happening as you read this. My purpose and vision for my life has never been as clear as it currently is. Some would say it’s simply an inspirational season. Others would say that God is moving through me.

One thing that I do know is that I’ve been chasing these invisible dots, and THEN finding new ways to connect those dots: treating every day like an adventure, like another chapter to a huge story. Building on something that's much bigger than myself. Searching for moments to be uncomfortable. Searching for new human interaction: from both people who could pour into my life, and from people that could use my help. Hugging strangers. Inviting them to my church. Asking if they need help with anything. Being a voice and vessel for the broken. Everyone has a story, and I’m doing everything I can to bring those stories together in creative and impactful ways.

Maybe that big project doesn't matter to you, but personal growth for yourself does. That's where this next thing comes in. Let's call it [The Thankful Project][1]. For almost a month now, the first thing I do when I wake up is think of three things I'm thankful for. Here’s what I [wrote][2] around the same time of starting this:

> Give thanks. That’s one thing that I know now more than anything. Be thankful for everything. It could all be taken away tomorrow. People, possessions, jobs: everything has an expiration date. It’ll all be gone soon, so treat each blessing as if you only have a brief moment with it. Take care of it. Leave it better than you found it. None of this is technically yours, so be a good steward to all things placed in your life. The people that’s there, treasure them. The possessions you own, take care of them. The time you’re given each day, use it as if the clock is ticking, because it is. Stay away from complacency. Stay uncomfortable. Find new ways to live your life to its fullest potential. And above all else, give thanks.

Doing this thank you list has changed everything for me. From the second I'm conscious to the second I fall asleep, I'm searching for things to be thankful for. If you look around you, from your eye glasses to the running water at your house, you have so many things around you to be excited about...because life would be much different without them. I encourage you to copy this idea. It's so simple. But it changed everything.
