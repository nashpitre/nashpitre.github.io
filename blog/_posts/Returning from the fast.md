I spent the last two months fasting and finding stillness throughout each day. Reading. Meditating. Disconnecting from technology. Praying. Removing the noise. It's brought complete clarity. I'm thankful for that, and I recommend it to anyone who’s flying too close to the sun.

I consider peace as important as oxygen, and there’s tools in front of us that can combat the distractions the world continues to throw at us. Slowly, they’ve made all of this normal (the memes, the echo chamber, the yelling, mindless sharing, the..internet), but it doesn't have to be this way. The internet is nothing more than your voice. What you share, whether you like it or not, defines who you are.

With all that being said, I’m back. The creative process has started again. Continue to visit nashp.com for all the new projects about to arrive. More than anything else though, I hope you're doing well.
