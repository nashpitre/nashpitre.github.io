title: Giving Nevaeh My iPad for Christmas
---

![][image-1]

I decided to give Nevaeh, my 8 year old sister, my iPad mini for Christmas. She told mom that she wants her own. Mom already told me she isn’t getting her one, she said she already spent enough on her for Christmas.

But if a kid wants an iPad, who am I to stand in their way? All kids should own two things: a toothbrush and an iPad—since there isn’t an app that’ll replace the toothbrush just yet.

I’ll spend the next 24 hours setting up the iPad to fit the things she likes. I know how happy this will make her, and I can’t think of a better person to give this to.
