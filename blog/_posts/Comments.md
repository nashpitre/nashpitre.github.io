# Commented from [For My Brother][1] album page

> My dude, tonight is the first time I’ve Hurd your mix. I think your words to the world are awesome. Personally I like heavy-metal music. I don’t really even give rap a chance, because it’s not my flavor ya know. I’ve already sent your words to both of my daughters, I know they gonna love this. Please keep doing what your doing. There are so many people that still need to hear you. GOD SPEED lil brother. Great job. Peace out ✌🏼

This is always one of my favorite compliments. I guess what I do is rap, but I don't make it for people that listen to rap. The style isn't something that a rap fan would probably like. There's nothing ‘cool’ about it. It's simply just storytelling that also rhymes. I appreciate you for checking it out.

> Just noticed the dark theme works on my browser. Very iconic and fresh.

Put your phone in dark mode, then visit my site. It's magic.

> SO AWESOME

Thank you. Not sure what you're referring to, but I'll take it as you're referring to the site as a whole. Lord knows I spend hours a day working on it. Currently finishing up the first of MANY books. I'll make sure to keep the awesome coming.

# Commented from [How To Find Yourself][4] page

> Dude Nash I love your blog and this site. Haven't been here in a while! A lot of good stuff! Hope you doing great man!

Thanks for stopping by. Come visit more often. I keep adding layers and layers to the blog (everywhere you look there's something rotating and cycling through all these thoughts and discoveries). I keep trying to make sure everything I create is showcased. It’s a challenge, but me and my friend [Jay][5] is making it possible every day. I appreciate you noticing and enjoying everything you’ve checked out.

I’m doing great. Well, I’m doing good. Great should be saved for better times. Can't really complain. It’s mostly internal. Little wars that I have with myself, anxiety and all that good stuff. But overall, life is going well. I have so much to be thankful for. I’ve been reading more. Playing the Xbox more. I’ve been weightlifting more. Just trying to improve my quality of life in all areas.

I hope this message reaches you, and I hope you’re doing great as well.
