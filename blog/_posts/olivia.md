### You kept saying you wanted to know more about me. I feel like you already know so much, but I’ll continue to try anyway. (This is me in a normal season, writing away, and creating, and turning a blank canvas into art.)

# Let’s start here

### You don’t know me. This pastor didn’t know me. He was visiting. But he saw something in me. Or, God made him the messenger for that day.

# A poem

#### These are just words, but they’re mine. In a short amount of time, God designed a space for me and you to create an atmosphere that’s divine. I see the signs. I see you’re trying. You see I’m trying. Our clocks are off though, we need the time. You see our minds: they intertwine like we are vines. My heart is big, it’s bleeding love. We’re meeting up. Heart’s racing, the beat is up. I see you love. It’s someone different. Is he enough? I’m sure he’s fine. But my vision is bigger, can he compete with mine? Follow your dreams, I hope they find you peace. However much time I get with you is still a lot to me. Perspective is everything. At once I didn’t have you. Now you’re in my life, and it’s hard to picture the alternative. Currently, I’m all worried, because it’s all blurry and I wanna see. I want you to want me, but only if you want to. I want to make music with you until we see the sun through the blinds and the album is done and we press play from song number one to the ending. Nothing more than a friendship. The thought of that penetrates like a knife inside of my ribs and it’s twisting. I like you more than a hug. I like you more than it being so simple that we can end it. I like you more than watching you walk away into the distance. God tell me how do I fix this. Was it even meant to be fixed, or was it temporary. I’ll leave it in your hands, let you control the blessings. Amen.

# Get To Know Me

I forget at times, because of how fast everything happened between us, that you don’t actually know all the little details of my life yet. You only know so much. And maybe that's why you’re wondering. We have all these big things happening between us, and you have decisions to make on your end, and you’re constantly with this guy now, that you barely know. Well, I hope these words can help somewhat.

# Receive Love

Last night’s small group assignment for this week is **receive love**. It’s not a coincidence that that word is now being used by you to me. Also, it was an assignment for a reason. Because it’s not always easy to receive it. As you can see, I’ve been pretty resistant to you these last 12 hours. My body and my mind has been in shock, and hasn’t been thinking clearly. But when I remove the noise, when I remove the doubt, when I remove the expectations—you’re still right there. Right in front of me. Open arms, offering the one thing I was assigned to do. Receive love. I accept.

# Losing Love

If there’s one common theme in my life, that continues to happen, and which is why I created the album The Loop (one of the only ones you haven’t listened to yet), is that my life has been on repeat for awhile now. The one pattern that continues to haunt me is this: **people leave**. I don’t know why. I can’t figure it out. I have all these blessings in every direction. So many successful things that have happened to me. I’m grateful for all of it. But, no matter what, people leave. Last night, for a very brief second, as I went to embrace you, my life flashed before my eyes, and I was reminded, that people leave. You didn’t mean anything more than to protect yourself and protect us. To put up guardrails. To save us from hurting each other. What that did though was cause thousands of memories to flood my mind, of people walking away. All I could do was be still in that moment and embrace it. Accept it. Understand that it’s beyond my control. People leave. That’s not my choice. That’s God’s. It hurts. But I have to continue to find peace with that.

# Memories

Speaking of those things, here’s time capsules for you to understand what I’m describing. **Strangers** and **The Loop**. Two little moments in time that might connect some dots.

I hope these words find you well. They’re a part of my past. They hurt. But they’re time capsules to help bring clarity and a life raft for someone else.

# Big Brother

I grew up in a broken home. The oldest of five (33, 30, 22, 14, 10). Other than me and my 30 year old brother, everyone else has different dads. Everyone else’s dad isn’t in the picture. I play the father figure to all of them. They give me life just as much as I give them.

# Basketball

Basketball saved my life. It’s been my heartbeat since I was six years old. I see the court at a slower speed than most people. It’s my escape. If it wasn’t for my collarbone, I'd be in the gym daily, working out, getting better, finding peace through the chaos of a basketball game.

# Container Homes

I’m a few months away from starting some new businesses. Shipping containers. With my dad. Here’s a glimpse of what they’ll sorta look like.

These will be available to rent, buy, and donate. There will also be one for a coffee cafe. All of this will be near Oakshire, on a property that I own. Next to the Karate shop, the blue building, that I’ll also be buying soon. All of these plans, along with the leather business we’re starting, is all about to launch later this year. (That combines with my current job, music, books, and other money I make from my website.)

# Music

I know you feel led to create with me. Maybe that’s the only reason you were sent to me. I have this concept in my head on how a new album should sound, with you singing on every song, almost at the same time as me. A very subtle sound with words connecting all over it and on top of the singing. We should start executing this concept immediately.

# The Other Guy

The elephant in the room. The person that has your heart. How could I be mad at that? He was there before me, and probably will be there after me. I'm glad you’ve found your person, and I hope it works out for you. I hope he gives you everything your heart desires and more. I truly wish the best for you two.

---- 

# The Other Guy (me)

The other elephant in the room. Me. I know my chances are slim to none, and I'm basically wasting my time entertaining the thought of a future with you. But it’s what my gut, my heart and spirit is telling me. It’s been like that since I laid eyes on you. And then as I have conversations with you, I can hear your soul. I can hear God speaking through you. I see vision. I see someone that hasn’t even come close to reaching her potential. Someone that will make a huge impact in this world. One person at a time. 

And if it’s God’s will, I’d like to be a part of that. I want to take you flying. I want to take you to Missouri to go hiking and go on adventures. I want to take you traveling with me on flights to  different states when I have conferences. I want to sleep under the stars with you. There’s so many things in this world that I would do with you. I should make a list. But before making that list, I should just be patient and make sure you’d like to join me. All I know is, you make my heart happy. And life is short. And if you find someone that makes your heart happy, chase them and tell them how you feel before it’s too late. That’s what I'm doing now.

Here’s my heart.
