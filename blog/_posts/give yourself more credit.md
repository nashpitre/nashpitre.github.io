title: Give Yourself More Credit
---

Give yourself more credit. Whatever your story is, whatever background you have, whatever your childhood looked like, whatever your current job status is: you’re here right now, and that alone means so much. It might not be where you imagined yourself being at this point, but I bet it took a lot for you to get here. Give yourself credit for where you’re at in this very moment. Even if it doesn’t feel like it sometimes, you’re winning. That mentality — the fighter mentality, the thankful mentality, and the mentality to know that you’ve made it this far, so you might as well keep going — will bring you to your next milestone.
