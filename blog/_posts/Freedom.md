# What Freedom Looks Like

### Freedom looks different to all of us. Here’s what it currently looks like to me.

#### Step 1: Decision

### The decision to say goodbye to my car on the left, to get the car on the right. It took a lot of decisions to make this happen.

#### Step 2: Freedom

### This is what freedom looks like. It’s old and loud and beautiful and paid off. The amount of money I’m saving per month now is incredible.

#### Step 3: What’s Next

### A Grom for everyday. The little green car will be for rainy days.

#### For years now, I've continued to find new ways to simplify my life. This is the newest way. There are still many more ways to come, that I’ll explain at a later time.

### The quickest way to get a raise on your paycheck is to shrink your cost of living. Getting down to the bare minimum is the end-goal, and today brings me that much closer.
