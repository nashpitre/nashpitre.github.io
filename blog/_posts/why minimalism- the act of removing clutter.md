# Why Minimalism: The Act of Removing Clutter

![][image-1]

I've been getting asked why I'm so obsessed with minimalism, so I'd like to share some thoughts on the topic. Letting go has made me a much better person. When I let go of something physical—that I no longer find value in—two things happen: it helps someone else in need, and then I'm able to see more of the things I love. Getting rid of clutter (both physical and mental) creates clarity for what truly matters. I've learned that relationships and memories are much more important than anything physical, and all these relationships were enhanced once I removed the insignificant things around them.

It all started with anxiety, which has been a major problem for me for most of my life, until now. I used to take all sorts of medication to try to help my anxiety, nerves, depression, insomnia, etc. — but letting go of the clutter cured me quicker than any pill ever could. I can't remember the last time I had to take medicine for any of these problems. Once the clutter was removed, the anxiety was gone. I now have room to breathe and think, and what was once filled with noise, has been replaced with peace and space around me for life to happen.
