Introducing our second business: **Roman Repairs**. A family business that’s simple: we fix things. If there’s something you need built or repaired, [get in touch][1].

My dad explained it this way:

The technical skills involved with remodeling commercial or residential projects will include: Finish-carpentry, Commercial or Residential Glass Construction, Framing, Additions/Add-ons, Roofing, Interior/Exterior, or any other work needed. We will make sure your job is perfected. When we’re finished, you will stand back and love what has been done. Let us do this for you. You’ll see.
