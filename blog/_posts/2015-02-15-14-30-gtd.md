# Getting Things Done (GTD)

I've been studying Getting Things Done (GTD) for years now, and anytime my life becomes overwhelming or too stressful, the very first thing I do is put all of my attention on my GTD setup[^1]. My setup is simply all the areas of my life that I consider important—such as short and long term goals. I've been planning to write about GTD, but it's a very detailed system to explain. Luckily though, I stumbled upon Joe Buhlig's blog.

Joe Buhlig:

> This is the start of a series of posts about GTD. It’s a system developed (or discovered depending on how you look at it) by David Allen in the [book by the same name][2] with the great subtitle “The Art of Stress-Free Productivity.” It’s a framework that solves our problem with “stuff.”

Joe then explains **Mind Like Water**:

> The main goal behind GTD is to free up your mind. As David Allen likes to say, “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” If you get things out of your head and into your trusted system, you can focus your mind on the task at hand or the person in front of you as opposed to remembering what you need to do next. It’s a way of bringing yourself back to the present because you’re not worrying about all the things you have to do.

> If you throw a rock into a calm pond, you see a splash and then some ripples start to form. The water reacts to forces around it in that moment and then slowly returns to its original state. GTD is a way to give your mind that ability. Getting things out of your mind and into a trusted system allows you to react to the new things coming at you and then return to your original state.

If any of this sounds like something you'd be interested in—which I highly recommend giving it a try (it's the only way I know how to be productive)—here's a series of posts that break it all down for you.
