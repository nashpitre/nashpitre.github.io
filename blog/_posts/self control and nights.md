- [Self Control][1]
- [Nights][2]

Here's two of my favorite songs from Frank Ocean's new album, [Blonde][3]. The depth of these songs are what stand out to me. It's many concepts, melodies, and even vocal pitches, all rolled into one track. One line could be talking about one subject, and the very next line is talking about something completely different. The speed of the tempo might not be fast, but the train of thought is racing. These type of moments are all over this album, but these two tracks point to it the most (others from the album that do this is "Nikes" and "Futura Free", two more of my favorites).

Here's a [link][4] to the album.
