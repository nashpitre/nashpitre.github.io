It’s exhausting when I think about the daily process I had in September. The amount of effort and energy it took to better myself. I saw areas in my life that I needed to grow: some were minor adjustments, others were complete overhauls. Each day, though, felt like a battle that came with decisions and actions that would allow me to let go of the past, stay present in the moment, and better myself for the future. That sums up my September: a month of pain and growth, from someone that had some broken pieces needing to be rebuilt. It keeps happening: a little season of discomfort transforms me into a person I could’ve never become without that discomfort. Now it’s October, and I’m feeling better than ever.

> “So, chosen by God for this new life of love, dress in the wardrobe God picked out for you: compassion, kindness, humility, quiet strength, discipline. Be even-tempered, content with second place, quick to forgive an offense. Forgive as quickly and completely as the Master forgave you. And regardless of what else you put on, wear love. It’s your basic, all-purpose garment. Never be without it.” Colossians‬ ‭3 MSG‬‬
